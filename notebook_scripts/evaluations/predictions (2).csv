1483,"the first two doses of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine provided adequate protection to some patients, the booster increased protection against the COVID-19 virus in almost all patients.","While two doses of mRNA vaccine only achieved adequate humoral immunity in a minority, the third vaccination boosts the development of virus-neutralizing quantities of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies (against wild type SARS-CoV-2) in almost all patients."
1484,Different boosters had earlier and stronger protection than boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine.,Both heterologous regimens induced responses earlier and with a higher amplitude than homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
1485,"Moreover, the body produced different protective chemicals at the same time.",There was no difference in latency between the IgG and IgA responses.

1489,a choice may make future COVID-19 boosters more successful.,Exercising individual autonomy may contribute to the success of future COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns.
1490,to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in those who had the first vaccines are needed because the level of protection against the virus decreases and people get COVID-19.,Reports of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals1 have prompted the recommendation for vaccine boosters to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.

1492,"Depending on the day of observation, a person could be in either group.",Person-days at risk were reported because individuals could contribute observations to both the nonbooster and booster groups.
1493,Infection and severe disease were estimated between booster and nonbooster groups that received the first Pfizer or Moderna vaccination.,"Using a Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of confirmed infections and severe disease between booster and nonbooster groups by type of vaccine received for the primary series (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273)."

1501,Symptomatic patients and repeated positive tests were admitted to the hospital and had positive results earlier.,The positive retest group showed shorter durations between symptom onset and hospitalization (P  0.001) and symptom onset and the first positive NAAT (P = 0.033).
1502,Coughing and a certain blood test result were each associated with a positive retest result.,Coughing and serum chloride concentrations were independent risk factors for positive NAAT retest results.
1503,Rapid diagnostic tests are useful for detecting COVID-19 virus.,Antigen-based rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) are useful tools for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection.
1504,social media demos of the RCT showed it can detect COVID-19 virus in tap water and food.,"However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products."
1505,"To combat misleading information, we studied the results of the non-conformity testing.","To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside manufacturer recommendations."

1512,"blood of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 100 healthy, the others had a proliferative or prenatal protein, 50 each.","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG in sera of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection, including rheumatoid factor (RF) positive group, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive group, pregnant women group, and normal senior group, with 50 in each group and 100 normal controls."
1513,"During April to June 2021, we received 279 nasal swabs from community testing, contact cases and suspected cases.","Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June, 2021 on 279 respiratory swabs originating from community surveillance, contact cases and suspect cases."
1514,"Statistically, the results ranged from moderate to strong.",Moderate to substantial level of agreement was reported among the three assays with kappa value between 0.55 and 0.72.
1515,"Die pharmacokinetics of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 gene were determined by a randomised, double-blinded trial.",These results help adjust the apparent prevalence determined by the three RT-PCRs and thus support public health decisions in resource limited settings and consider alternatives as per their prioritization matrix.
1516,"Compared with placebo, this study compared three different types of zinc drugs and 15 healthy subjects.",The comparative absorption of zinc after oral administration of three different complexed forms was studied in 15 healthy human volunteers in a double-blind four-period crossover trial.
1517,"Hence, zinc picolinate is the best pill to take to get more zinc into the body.",The results of this study suggest that zinc absorption in humans can be improved by complexing zinc with picolinic acid.
1518,"In this study, we investigated the intramuscular zinc intake of 15 healthy volunteers after different supplementation.",The comparative absorption of zinc after oral administration of three different complexed forms was studied in 15 healthy human volunteers in a double-blind four-period crossover trial.

1520,"there was a small increase in the levels of zinc in the clear liquid portion of the blood after administration of zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo.","There was a small, insignificant rise in serum zinc during zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo supplementation."
1521,"The objective of this study was to determine which type of zinc lozenges work best, the type that has high stability constants or the type that has low stability constants.",Objective: To examine whether zinc salts with low stability constants were more suitable as sources of zinc in zinc lozenges than zinc salts with high stability constants.
1522,The results show that the zinc lozenges were effective no matter the stability constant.,Results and conclusion: The lozenge with the highest stability constant was as effective as those with very low stability constants.
1523,Zinc is known to interfere with volatile sulphur compounds.,The anti-VSC (volatile sulphur compounds) effect of zinc is known to be associated with free zinc ions.
1524,We investigated which zinc salts are better to use in zinc lozenges.,Objective: To examine whether zinc salts with low stability constants were more suitable as sources of zinc in zinc lozenges than zinc salts with high stability constants.
1525,Several zinc salts break down in water more easily and let out more free zinc.,"The former provide free zinc ions upon dissolution in water, whereas the latter provide few such ions."
1526,we prepared similar lozenges that contained either zinc acetate or zinc gluconate (zinc citrate) or non-zinc-acid chelated zinc.,"Design and participants: Identical lozenges were produced which contained either zinc acetate, zinc gluconate (low stability constants), zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc (extremely high stability constants)."
1527,"Similarly, the results for all lozenges may be due to some oral zinc-binding compounds stronger than the salts in the lozenges.",These findings may be explained by the possibility that alternative ligands with stronger affinity for zinc than the original ligands in the lozenges may be present in the oral cavity.
1528,"Using zinc gluconate and zinc oxide, we compare the use of two different forms of zinc.","Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of zinc gluconate (organic) were compared with those of zinc oxide (inorganic)."
1529,"In conclusion, the yeast with zinc supplement gave more Zn than the zinc gluconate supplement.",It was concluded that organic Zn yeast supplements are more biologically available than Zn gluconate salts.
1530,"During the study, we measured the total amount of zinc and its availability in the body.",The net Zn balance and the relative bioavailability were calculated.
1531,Zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but was removed less with the stools.,Zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but showed significantly less loss in the feces.
1532,All of the various forms of zinc caused cell death at high concentrations except for the form called zinc histidinate.,"At concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 mM Zn(2+) a significant decrease in GSH and ATP levels preceded cell death induced by all salts, except of zinc-histidinate."
1533,"absorbed more zinc from the zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate forms, suggesting that there may be a relationship between the amount of zinc absorbed and cell death.","Interestingly, the uptake of Zn(2+) from zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate was significantly higher than that of other salts, implicating a correlation between uptake and toxicity."
1534,Zn can be divided into three different categories based on their toxicity to cells.,"In conclusion, Zn(2+)-salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride(,) zinc-gluconate) and low cytotoxicity (zinc-histidinate)."
1535,"Several factors determine zinc absorption, but the most important is the amount of zinc a person gets.","Several physiologic factors, most notably the quantity of zinc ingested, determine the quantity of zinc absorbed and the efficiency of absorption."
1536,Zn absorption is not different whether the zinc comes from supplements like pills or from food.,Zinc from supplements has not been shown to be absorbed differently from that taken with meals that lack inhibitors of zinc absorption.
1537,Whether zinc is lost and absorbed is important to know so that people get the right amount of zinc.,The quantitative relation of intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc to zinc absorption is currently considered to be of major importance in the determination of zinc requirements.
1538,the body maintains the balance of zinc through a series of enzymes that take zinc into cells according to needs.,"Regulation of absorption by zinc transporters in the enterocyte, together with saturation kinetics of the absorption process into and across the enterocyte, are the principal means by which whole-body zinc homeostasis is maintained."
1539,"Moreover, there is no difference between the supplements and the meals.",Zinc from supplements has not been shown to be absorbed differently from that taken with meals that lack inhibitors of zinc absorption.
1540,Models show that the majority of differences in zinc absorption is due to the presence of zinc and phytate in the food.,Modeling of zinc absorption as a function of dietary zinc and phytate accounts for >80% of the variability in the quantity of zinc absorbed.
1541,"model shows that an adult body takes in about 6 milligrams a day, and if the daily meals contain a gram of phytate, twice the recommended daily amount of zinc is needed.","Fitting the model to new data has resulted in continual improvement in parameter estimates, which currently indicate a maximal absorption in adults of approximately 6 mg Zn/d and that the average estimated dietary requirement doubles with 1000 mg dietary phytate/d."
1542,"Zn supplementation is better absorbed than food, but the difference disappears within 24 hours though.","Supplemental zinc taken with water in the post-absorptive state initially is absorbed more efficiently than food zinc, but absorption efficiency declines within 24 hours presumably due to down-regulation of the zinc transporters."
1543,"Nevertheless, more research needs to be done to understand the mechanism of zinc absorption in different contexts.",More research is needed to understand the effect of physiological state on zinc absorption.
1544,intake does not depend on the amount of zinc taken in the past or currently.,"There is no evidence that past zinc intakes, or status, influences zinc absorption."
1545,"Rather, zinc consumption with food determines the amount of zinc that will enter the body.","Instead, current zinc intake is the chief determinant of zinc absorption."
1546,"This study compared the absorption of zinc from zinc citrate by giving 15 people 10 mg of zinc citrate without requiring them to take it along with food, and the results were compared to the absorption of zinc gulconate and zinc oxide.","We used the double-isotope tracer method with (67) Zn and (70) Zn to measure zinc absorption from zinc citrate given as supplements containing 10 mg of zinc to 15 healthy adults without food and compared absorption with that from zinc gluconate and zinc oxide (insoluble in water) using a randomized, double-masked, 3-way crossover design."
1547,"The results show that zinc citrate is as good as zinc gulconate at being absorbed by the human body, and it is another effective option to prevent zinc deficiency and for treating diarrhea.","We conclude that zinc citrate, given as a supplement without food, is as well absorbed by healthy adults as zinc gluconate and may thus be a useful alternative for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea."
1548,"Zn oxide is not absorbed as well by the human body when given without food, and some people may not absorb any zinc at all or may barely absorb any.",The more insoluble zinc oxide is less well absorbed when given as a supplement without food and may be minimally absorbed by some individuals.
1549,"A third source of zinc is zinc citrate, which tastes better in syrups, but its toxicity is not known.","Zinc citrate is an alternative compound with high zinc content, slightly soluble in water, which has better sensory properties in syrups but no absorption data in humans."
1550,"We measured zinc intake in 15 healthy adults after dietary zinc supplementation (Zn citrate, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide).","We used the double-isotope tracer method with (67) Zn and (70) Zn to measure zinc absorption from zinc citrate given as supplements containing 10 mg of zinc to 15 healthy adults without food and compared absorption with that from zinc gluconate and zinc oxide (insoluble in water) using a randomized, double-masked, 3-way crossover design."
1551,citrate supplementation provided as much zinc to healthy adults as zinc gluconate and may be another useful supplement for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea.,"We conclude that zinc citrate, given as a supplement without food, is as well absorbed by healthy adults as zinc gluconate and may thus be a useful alternative for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea."

1839,The correct diagnosis and treatment results in improvement of the symptoms.,The appropriate diagnosis and treatment leads the symptoms to subside.
1840,The severity of SCD can vary depending on the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF).,Interindividual variation in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a known and potentially heritable modifier of SCD severity.
1841,has shown a correlation between a single BCL11A mutation and HbF levels in some SCD patients.,"We recently demonstrated an association between a BCL11A SNP and HbF levels in one SCD cohort [Uda M, et al. (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:1620-1625]."
1842,are also associated with the number of pain crises in SCD patients.,We also have shown that HbF-associated SNPs associate with pain crisis rate in SCD patients.
1843,Increasing levels of HbF may be due to other mutations in various hemoglobin genes.,"Increased HbF may result from rare deletions within the Î2-globin gene cluster or from point mutations in the promoters of the fetal Î3-globin genes (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, HPFH), but additional loci are known to increase HbF levels in adult life."
