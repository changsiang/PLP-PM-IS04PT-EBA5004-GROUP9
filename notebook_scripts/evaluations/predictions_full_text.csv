SCD occurs when a mutation of the Beta-hemoglobin gene causes the amino acid, glutamic acid, to be replaced by valine in the beta chain of the hemoglobin protein. The signs and symptoms in SCD occur because these sickle hemoglobin (HbS) proteins tend to join together where oxygen levels are lower in the body. This causes the red blood cells to change into the typical abnormal rigid sickle cell shape. These rigid red blood cells cannot pass through the smallest blood vessels well.This causes the vessels to be blocked",summarize: summarize: summarize: Conclusion: there is evidence that perphenazine is effective in the prevention of PONV in children and adults without serious adverse effects compared with placebo.
