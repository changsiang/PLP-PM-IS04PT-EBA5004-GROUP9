27852303,"In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05).",We concluded that powdered Nigella sativa improved thyroid function and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
27852303,Conclusions: Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.,Nigella sativa lowered blood VEGF levels.
27852303,"Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients.",Nigella sativa can be a useful non-traditional treatment for people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis to make the disease less severe.
27852303,Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hypothyroidism.,Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) occurs when immune cells mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells.
27852303,"The use of Nigella sativa, a potent herbal medicine, continues to increase worldwide as an alternative treatment of several chronic diseases including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",It is the most common cause of reduced thyroid function.
27852303,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, increases globally as an alternative treatment for many long-lasting diseases like high blood pressure, high blood fat, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)."
27852303,"Methods: Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, aged between 22 and 50 years old, participated in the trial and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control receiving powdered Nigella sativa or placebo daily for 8 weeks.","The current work evaluates how Nigella sativa affects thyroid function, blood protein levels, and physical measurements in those with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation."
27852303,"Changes in anthropometric variables, dietary intakes, thyroid status, serum VEGF and Nesfatin-1 concentrations after 8 weeks were measured.","Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation, aged 22 through 50, were randomly split into two groups receiving powdered Nigella sativa or inactive treatment daily for 8 weeks."
27852303,Results:,Using an herbal medicine reduced body weight and body mass index.
27852303,Treatment with Nigella sativa significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI).,Blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid cell proteins decreased while thyroid product levels increased in the Nigella sative-treated group after 8 weeks.
27852303,Serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies decreased while serum T3 concentrations increased in Nigella sativa-treated group after 8 weeks.,The treatment group showed reduced blood vessel signaling protein.
27852303,There was a significant reduction in serum VEGF concentrations in intervention group.,No changes occured in the inactive treatment group.
27852303,None of these changes had been observed in placebo treated group.,Changes in waist to hip ratio and thyroid hormones were linked to changes in certain blood protein levels in the Nigella sative-treated group.
27852303,"In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05).",Nigella sativa may improve thyroid and general health in those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation).
27852303,Conclusions: Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.,"Also, Nigella sativa (an herbal medicine) reduces blood vessel signaling protein in these patients."
27852303,"Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients.","Due to its health-promoting effect, this medicinal plant can be a useful treatment for Hashimoto's thyroidits."
32740045,"Purpose of review: The aim of the article is to present the basics of oral levothyroxine (LT4) absorption, reasons why patients may have persistently elevated serum thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH) levels, and alternative strategies for LT4 dosing.","This article aims to cover the basics of how well levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication) is absorbed when taken by mouth, reasons why people may have continuously high blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, and other ways to take levothyroxine."
32740045,"Recent findings: Although oral LT4 tablets are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in patients with hypothyroidism, case studies report that liquid oral LT4, intravenous, intramuscular, and rectal administration of LT4 can successfully treat refractory hypothyroidism.","Although LT4 tablets taken by mouth are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in people with underactive thyroids, studies show that taking LT4 in liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, and through the rectum can work to treat poorly-controlled underactive thyroid."
32740045,Summary: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders encountered by primary care physicians and endocrinologists.,Underactive thyroid is one of the most common hormone disorders doctors see.
32740045,LT4 is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world and it is the standard of care treatment for hypothyroidism.,LT4 is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and is the recommended treatment for underactive thyroid.
32740045,"Generally, hypothyroid patients will be treated with LT4 tablets to be taken orally, and monitoring will occur with routine serum thyroid tests, including TSH concentrations.","Generally, people with underactive thyroids will take LT4 tablets by mouth and track thryoid levels with common blood thyroid tests, including measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone."
32740045,"However, many patients fail to maintain serum TSH levels in the target range while managed on oral LT4 tablets.",Taking LT4 tablets by mouth does not keep blood thyroid-stimulating hormone levels at the right level for many people.
32740045,"A subset of these patients would be considered to have poorly controlled hypothyroidism, sometimes termed refractory hypothyroidism.","Some of these people may have poorly-controlled underactive thyroids, or refractory underactive thyroids."
32740045,"For these patients, optimization of ingestion routines and alternative formulations and routes of administration of LT4 can be considered, including oral liquid, intravenous, intramuscular, and even rectal formulations.","This group of people might need to take LT4 in other forms or other ways, including liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, or even through the rectum."
29490937,Hypothyroidism is one of the most common hormone deficiencies in adults.,Underactive thyroid is one of the most common conditions caused by a lack of specific hormones in adults.
29490937,"Most of the cases, particularly those of overt hypothyroidism, are easily diagnosed and managed, with excellent outcomes if treated adequately.",Underactive thyroid is usually easily identified and successfully treated.
29490937,"However, minor alterations of thyroid function determine nonspecific manifestations.","However, small changes in thyroid function determine symptoms that can be caused by many conditions."
29490937,Primary hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is largely the most common cause of thyroid hormone deficiency.,"Primary underactive thyroid caused by a long-term inflamed thyroid, which in turn is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, is the most common cause of too little thyroid hormones in adults."
29490937,"Central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased thyroid hormone secretion by an otherwise normal thyroid gland, due to lack of TSH.","Central underactive thyroid, which is not very common and has many causes, is when an otherwise normal thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone due to lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone."
29490937,The standard treatment of primary and central hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine sodium (LT4).,Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4) is the normal treatment of primary and central underactive thyroid.
29490937,"Treatment guidelines of hypothyroidism recommend monotherapy with LT4 due to its efficacy, long-term experience, favorable side effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life and low cost.","Treatment guidelines for an underactive thyroid recommend a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4), because of how well it works, how long it has been used, few side effects, how easy it is to use, how well it is absorbed in the stomach, how long it lasts in the blood, and low cost."
29490937,"Despite being easily treatable with a daily dose of LT4, many patients remain hypothyroid due to malabsorption syndromes, autoimmune gastritis, pancreatic and liver disorders, drug interactions, polymorphisms in DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2), high fiber diet, and more frequently, non-compliance to LT4 therapy.","Although taking LT4 daily treats underactive thyroid, many people still have underactive thyroids due to conditions that do not allow absorption in the stomach, inflammation of the stomach lining caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, pancreatic and live disease, two or more drugs interacting with each other, gene variations, eating too much fiber, and more commonly, not following the prescribed LT4 treatment."
29490937,Compliance to levothyroxine treatment in hypothyroidism is compromised by daily and fasting schedule.,Taking levothyroxine as prescribed for underactive thyroid depends on when and if it is taken on an empty stomach.
29490937,Many adult patients remain hypothyroid due to all the above mentioned and many attempts to improve levothyroxine therapy compliance and absorption have been made.,"For all of these reasons, many adults still have underactive thyroids."
29381251,"Objective: Hypothyroidism is relatively common, occurring in approximately 5% of the general US population aged ???12 years.","Underactive thyroid is relatively common, occurring in about 5% of the general U.S. population 12 years and older."
29381251,Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy is the standard of care.,"The recommended treatment is a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication)."
29381251,"Approximately, 5%-10% of patients who normalise thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with LT4 monotherapy may have persistent symptoms that patients and clinicians may attribute to hypothyroidism.",About 5%-10% of patients who use LT4 alone to regulate thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may have ongoing symptoms that patients and doctors may think are caused by underactive thyroid.
29381251,A long-standing debate in the literature is whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3) to LT4 will ameliorate lingering symptoms.,Science disagrees as to whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3 - another thryoid medication) to LT4 will improve these ongoing symptoms.
29381251,"Here, we explore the evidence for and against LT4/LT3 combination therapy as the optimal approach to treat euthyroid patients with persistent complaints.",We look at whether combining LT4 and LT3 is the best way to treat patients with normal thyroid function but ongoing symptoms.

29381251,Findings:,We did not find strong proof that combining LT4 and LT3 worked to treat patients with underactive thyroids.
29381251,Current clinical evidence is not sufficiently strong to support LT4/LT3 combination therapy in patients with hypothyroidism.,Genes that cause less conversion of T4 to T3 may explain unsuccessful treatment with LT4.
29381251,Polymorphisms in deiodinase genes that encode the enzymes that convert T4 to T3 in the periphery may provide potential mechanisms underlying unsatisfactory treatment results with LT4 monotherapy.,The benefit of adding LT3 to LT4 treatment is uncertain.
29381251,"However, results of studies on the effect of LT4/LT3 therapy on clinical symptoms and thyroid-responsive genes have thus far not been conclusive.",Ongoing symptoms in patients with normal thyroid function may be due to other causes.
29381251,"Conclusions: Persistent symptoms in patients who are biochemically euthyroid with LT4 monotherapy may be caused by several other conditions unrelated to thyroid function, and their cause should be aggressively investigated by the clinician.",A doctor should determine the cause of the ongoing symptoms.
29381251,"Objective: Hypothyroidism is relatively common, occurring in approximately 5% of the general US population aged ???12 years.",Low thyroid function occurs in around 5% of the US population aged ???12 years.
29381251,Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy is the standard of care.,Levothyroxine (LT4) (a thyroid hormonal drug) is standard treatment.
29381251,"Approximately, 5%-10% of patients who normalise thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with LT4 monotherapy may have persistent symptoms that patients and clinicians may attribute to hypothyroidism.",Around 5-10% of patients with regular thyroid-stimulating hormone levels after LT4 may still have symptoms attributable to reduced thyroid funciton.
29381251,A long-standing debate in the literature is whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3) to LT4 will ameliorate lingering symptoms.,"Experts debate if adding levotriiodothyronine (LT3), another manmade thyroid hormone, to LT4 will help lingering symptoms."
29381251,"Here, we explore the evidence for and against LT4/LT3 combination therapy as the optimal approach to treat euthyroid patients with persistent complaints.",We explore evidence for and against LT4/LT3 double treatment for best treating patients with lingering thyroid issues.

29381251,Relevant non-review articles published in English during the past 10 years were included and supplemented with articles already known to the authors.,Current evidence does not support LT4/LT3 double treatment for those with reduced thyroid function.
29381251,Findings:,Variations in genes blueprinting enzymes that convert thyroid hormone from one form to another may explain the lack of improvement with LT4 treatment.
29381251,Current clinical evidence is not sufficiently strong to support LT4/LT3 combination therapy in patients with hypothyroidism.,"However, studies of LT4/LT3 double treatment are not conclusive."
29381251,Polymorphisms in deiodinase genes that encode the enzymes that convert T4 to T3 in the periphery may provide potential mechanisms underlying unsatisfactory treatment results with LT4 monotherapy.,"Lingering symptoms in patients with normal thyroids from LT4 therapy may be from other thyroid-unrelated causes, which should be investigated by the clinician."
26926973,"Hyperthyroidism is an excessive concentration of thyroid hormones in tissues caused by increased synthesis of thyroid hormones, excessive release of preformed thyroid hormones, or an endogenous or exogenous extrathyroidal source.","Overactive thyroid is when too much thyroid hormone produced, when too much stored thyroid hormone released, or when there are internal or external thyroid hormone sources outside the thyroid."
26926973,"The most common causes of an excessive production of thyroid hormones are Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma.","The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone made are Graves disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and results in an overactive thyroid, or when one or more glandular growths make extra thyroid hormone."
26926973,"The most common cause of an excessive passive release of thyroid hormones is painless (silent) thyroiditis, although its clinical presentation is the same as with other causes.","The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone released is thyroid inflammation, although the signs are the same as other causes."
26926973,"Hyperthyroidism caused by overproduction of thyroid hormones can be treated with antithyroid medications (methimazole and propylthiouracil), radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland, or surgical thyroidectomy.","Overactive thyroid can be treated with drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the thyroid."
26926973,Radioactive iodine ablation is the most widely used treatment in the United States.,Radiation therapy is the most widely used treatment in the United States.
26926973,"The choice of treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis, the presence of contraindications to a particular treatment modality, the severity of hyperthyroidism, and the patient's preference.","The choice of treatment depends on the diagnosis, reasons not to use a particular method, how serious the overactive thyroid is, and what the patient wants."
16127951,The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology.,Successfully treating an overactive thyroid depends on identifying the signs and symptoms of the disease and determining the cause.
16127951,The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease.,"Graves' disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells, is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid."
16127951,"Other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications.","Other common causes of an overactive thyroid include thyroid inflammation, one or more glandular growths making extra thyroid hormone, and side effects of some medications."
16127951,The diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test.,A common test that measures blood levels of hormones that acts as messengers to the thyroid is the first step in a medical exam.
16127951,"When test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes.","When results of this test are uncertain, a test to measure thyroid function can be used."
16127951,"When thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient.","When the cause is inflammation of the thyroid, treating the symptoms is enough because the overactive thyroid is short-lived."
16127951,"Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the United States, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications.","Graves' disease and when one or more growths make extra thyroid hormone can be treated with radiation therapy, drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, or surgery."
16127951,"Thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms.","In the United States, radiation therapy to shrink the thyroid is preferred unless there is a reason not to do so."
16127951,Some new therapies are under investigation.,"Thyroid removal is an option when other treatments do not work or should not be used, or when an enlarged thyroid is causing pressure or squeezing."
16127951,"Special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with Graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.",New treatments are being studied.
16127951,"Patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.","People who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with thyroid eye disease or overactive thyroids caused by amiodarone, a heart medication, must be given special treatment consideration."
1000139,The chemical structure of a neuroleptic does not relaibly predict the exact profile of its therapeutic action.,The chemical structure (arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule) of drugs used to treat psychotic disorders does not reliably predict how well the treatment works.
1000139,"We considered the question whether the biochemical action of a neuroleptic, and specifically the ratio between DA-receptor block and NA-receptor block, might have a higher predictive value in this respect.",We looked into whether the biological and chemical changes made to the body by a drug to treat psychotic disorders might better predict how well the treatment works.
1000139,In this context we carried out a double-blind study of the therapeutic value of clozapine and perphenazine in acute psychoses of varying symptomatology and aetiology.,We did a study of how well antipsychotics clozapine and perphenazine treat short-term impaired relationships with reality with varying symptoms and causes.
1000139,"There are strong indications that clozapine has only a slight inhibitory effect on transmission in central DA-ergic neurons, but markedly inhibits transmission in central NA-ergic neurons, and that the reverse applies to perphenazine.",Data suggest that clozapine and perphenazine have opposite effects on two types of neurons or brain cells.
1000139,"In view of these data we expected perphenazine to be a stronger antipsychotic and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa.","We thought that perphenazine would be a stronger drug to treat impaired relationships with reality and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa."
1000139,The plausibility of this hypothesis was demonstrated.,This assumption proved reasonable.
1000139,"Partly also on the basis of earlier research, we concluded that the biochemical action of a neuroleptic is a more faithful predictor of its therapeutic action profile than the chemical structure.","Partly based on earlier research, we concluded that the biological and chemical changes to the body made by a drug used to treat psychotic disorders better predicts how well the treatment works than the arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule."
13667001,CLINICAL experience with tranquilizers has shown the need for prolonged therapy for chronic neurotic and psychotic disorders.,Use of tranquilizers on patients has shown the need for long-term treatment of long-term neurotic and pyschotic mental disorders.
13667001,"Since phenothiazine derivatives such as perphenazine are being employed in this manner and since there have been rare reports of jaundice and leukopenia associated with its administration, questions about a potential deleterious effect of this drug on the liver and blood have to be answered.","Because antipsychotic drugs like perphenazine are being used to treat long-term mental disorders and there have been rare cases of yellowing of the skin and a decrease in disease-fighting cells in the blood of people who take it, we must figure out whether this drug harms the liver and blood."

33099901,All these attributes argue for a trial of perphenazine's addition to current standard treatment with temozolomide and irradiation.,These qualities suggest the addition of perphenazine to current chemotherapy and radiation treatment should be studied.
33099901,The subventricular zone seeds the brain with mutated cells that become recurrent glioblastoma after centrifugal migration.,Part of the brain sends out damaged cells that become recurring glioblastoma after they move outward.

33099901,Conclusions: Perphenazine possesses a remarkable constellation of attributes that recommend its use in GB treatment.,Perphenazine has many attributes that recommend its use in glioblastoma treatment.
25749632,Background: Perphenazine is an old phenothiazine antipsychotic with a potency similar to haloperidol.,"Perphenazine is an old drug used to treat psychotic disorders with strength similar to haloperidol, another drug to treat psychotic disorders."
25749632,It has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan.,Perphenazine has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan.
25749632,Objectives: To examine the clinical effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.,We aimed to look at the effects and safety of perphenazine in people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness) and schizophrenia-like disorders.
25749632,"Authors' conclusions: Although perphenazine has been used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparators used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions.","We conclude that although perphenazine has been used for more than 50 years, incomplete results and the variety of drugs used to compare perphenazine to make it impossible to make clear judgements."
25749632,All data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence.,The results used in this review were not reliable.
25749632,At best we can say that perphenazine showed similar effects and adverse events as several of the other antipsychotic drugs.,The most we can say is that perphenazine had similar results and side effects as many other drugs used to treat psychotic disorders.
25749632,"Since perphenazine is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used compound, further trials are justified to clarify the properties of this classical antipsychotic drug.","Because perphenazine is a cheap and often used drug, more studies are needed to fully understand the drug's properties."
25290157,Background: Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia.,Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are the main treatment for schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness).
25290157,"Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between the various first-generation antipsychotics, however, low-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs are sometimes perceived as less efficacious than high-potency first-generation compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects.",Treatment recommendations say there is no difference in treatment effect among older drugs used to treat psychotic disorders.
25290157,Authors' conclusions: The results do not show a superiority in efficacy of high-potency perphenazine compared with low-potency first-generation antipsychotics.,"However, doctors sometimes think older drugs with lower strength used to treat psychotic disorders do not work as well as older drugs with higher strength, and they also seem to have different side effects."
25290157,"There is some evidence that perphenazine is more likely to cause akathisia and less likely to cause severe toxicity, but most adverse effect results were equivocal.",We conclude that the results do not show that the antipsychotic perphenazine with its higher strength works better than older antipsychotics with lower strength.

31239388,Results:,Researchers studied Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in different parts of the kidneys by using two different types of mice (called wild-type mice - or normal mice - and knockout mice - mice without a specific gene like the one encoding Kir5.1)
31239388,"We detected a 40-pS and 20-pS potassium channel in the basolateral membrane of the DCT in wild-type and knockout mice, respectively.","fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets."
31239388,"Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice fed a normal potassium diet had higher basolateral potassium conductance, a more negative DCT membrane potential, higher expression of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) and total NCC (tNCC), and augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis.","When compared with the wild-type mice, the knockout mice that were fed a normal potassium diet had higher transmission of potassium, had more negative charges in some cell boundaries or membranes, had higher activation of major salt reabsorption pathways, and had an increase in the release of sodium in the urine."
31239388,Neither high- nor low-potassium diets affected the basolateral DCT's potassium conductance and membrane potential in Kcnj16-/- mice.,Neither a diet high nor low in potassium affected the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell or the negative charges in the cell membranes in the knockout mice.
31239388,"Although high potassium reduced and low potassium increased the expression of pNCC and tNCC in wild-type mice, these effects were absent in Kcnj16-/- mice.","Although high potassium reduced activation of major salt reabsorption pathways and low potassium increased activation of major salt reabsorption pathways in wild-type mice, these effects were not found in the knockout mice."
31239388,High potassium intake inhibited and low intake augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis in wild-type but not in Kcnj16-/- mice.,High potassium diets slowed or stopped release of sodium in the urine while low potassium diets increased the release of sodium in the urine in wild-type mice but not in knock-out mice.
31239388,"Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice with normal potassium intake had slightly lower plasma potassium but were more hyperkalemic with prolonged high potassium intake and more hypokalemic during potassium restriction.","When compared with wild-type mice, knockout mice who had normal potassium level diets had slightly lower plasma potassium (potassium in the blood)."
31239388,Conclusions: Kir5.1 is essential for dietary potassium's effect on NCC and for maintaining potassium homeostasis.,"However, knockout mice were more hyperkalemic (having a higher than normal level of potassium in the bloodstream) with a long, high potassium diet and hypokalemic (having a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood) with a restricted potassium diet."

29218312,OS and abnormalities in potassium channel have been reported in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Oxidative stress (a condition that happens when the body has low antioxidant levels, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells), and potassium imbalance (levels of potassium that are not normal) can cause life threatening health conditions."
29218312,"This review highlights the major factors involved in potassium homeostasis (dietary, hormonal, genetic, and physiologic influences), and discusses the major diseases and abnormalities associated with potassium imbalance including hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and Gordon's syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome.",Oxidative stress and changes in how potassium passes through cells are reported in neurodegenerative diseases (diseases such as Alzheimer's where nerve cells deteriorate or die).
27536695,"Background: Potassium (K(+)) is the major intracellular cation, with 98% of the total pool being located in the cells at a concentration of 140-150 mmol/l, and only 2% in the extracellular fluid, where it ranges between 3.5 and 5 mmol/l. A fine regulation of the intracellular-extracellular gradient is crucial for life, as it is the main determinant of membrane voltage; in fact, acute changes of K(+) plasma levels may have fatal consequences.",There is a large amount of potassium (a mineral the body needs to function properly) in the fluid within cells.
27536695,Summary: An integrated system including an 'internal' and 'external' control prevents significant fluctuations of plasma levels in conditions of K(+) loading and depletion.,"Regulating or monitoring how potassium passes in and out of cells is very important, so sudden or major changes of potassium levels in the blood may be life-threatening."
27536695,"The internal control regulates the intra-extracellular shift, a temporary mechanism able to maintain a constant K(+) plasma concentration without changing the total amount of body K(+).",The body has a system with 'internal' and 'external' controls that prevents changes of blood levels when potassium is increasing or decreasing.
27536695,"The external control is responsible for the excretion of the ingested K(+), and it has the kidney as the major player.",The 'internal' control monitors the change in potassium as it moves in and out of cells to help maintain a stable level of potassium.
27536695,The kidney excretes nearly 90% of the daily intake.,"The 'external' control is responsible for excreting (releasing) the potassium, and the kidney is the main part of this process."
27536695,"Along the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb on Henle's loop, the amount of K(+) reabsorption is quite fixed (about 80-90%); conversely, the distal nephron has the ability to adjust K(+) excretion in accordance with homeostatic needs.",The kidney releases nearly 90% of the daily intake of potassium.
27536695,"The present review analyzes: (1) the main molecular mechanisms mediating K(+) reabsorption and secretion along the nephron; (2) the pathophysiology of the principal K(+) derangements due to renal dysfunction, and (3) the effect of ingested K(+) on blood pressure and renal electrolyte handling.","In some parts within the kidney, potassium is reabsorbed at a fixed or constant amount, but other portions of the kidneys have the ability to adjust the release of potassium based on what is needed to maintain a potassium balance."
27536695,"Key messages: Maintaining plasma K(+) levels in a tight range is crucial for life; thus, multiple factors are implicated in K(+) homeostasis, including kidney function.",This review analyzes the following: (1) the cell processes that reabsorb and release potassium along the nephron (a filter located in the kidneys); (2) the pathophysiology (functional changes in the body that come with a particular syndrome or disease) from renal (kidney-related) problems; and (3) the effect of ingested potassium from food on blood pressure and renal electrolytes.
27536695,"Recent studies have suggested that K(+) plasma levels, in turn, affect renal salt absorption in animal models; this effect may underlie the reduction of blood pressure observed in hypertensive subjects under K(+) supplementation.",Key messages in this review are that maintaining potassium levels in the blood in a tight range is very important for life.
27306796,Purpose of review: Renal potassium (K) secretion plays a key role in maintaining K homeostasis.,Renal (kidney-related) secretion or release plays a key role in maintaining potassium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid outside the cells).
27306796,"The classic mechanism of renal K secretion is focused on the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct, in which K is uptaken by basolateral Na-K-ATPase and is secreted into the lumen by apical ROMK (Kir1.1) and Ca-activated big conductance K channel.",Renal release of potassium mainly takes place within the kidneys through as series of tubes and ducts.

27306796,"Moreover, the downregulation of Kir4.1 increases epithelial Na channel expression in the collecting duct and urinary K excretion.",Kir4.1 also activates proteins that send signals to other cells which in turn activate Kir4.1 activity in the DCT.
27306796,"Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia.","Kir4.1 depolarizes (changes the internal charge to make the cell less negative) the membrane of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), slows down other proteins that regulate cell activity, and suppresses NaCl cotransporter activity."

27151921,We recently described a novel thiazide-sensitive electroneutral NaCl transport mechanism resulting from the parallel operation of the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger pendrin and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in ??-intercalated cells of the collecting duct.,Past studies describe a new process to transport and reabsorb sodium and chloride ions (atoms or molecules that carry electrical charges) from one side of the cell to the other.
27151921,"Although a role for pendrin in maintaining Na+ balance, intravascular volume, and BP is well supported, there is no in vivo evidence for the role of NDCBE in maintaining Na+ balance.",One is called the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) that is a protein that exchanges Na+ (sodium) from outside the cell for Cl- (chloride) that is in the cell.
27151921,"Here, we show that deletion of NDCBE in mice caused only subtle perturbations of Na+ homeostasis and provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) compensated for the inactivation of NDCBE.",There is no lab or test tube experiments that show evidence for the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in maintaining a sodium balance.

27151921,"On a normal salt diet, dKO and single-knockout mice exhibited similar activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, whereas only dKO mice displayed a lower blood K+ concentration.",Researchers provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells) compensated for the lack of action of the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger.
27151921,"Furthermore, dKO mice displayed upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the Ca2+-activated K+ channel BKCa.","To understand the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger, researchers generated an experiment with Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice, mice without NCC or NDCBE."

27151921,"Notably, the increase in aldosterone levels expected on NaCl depletion was attenuated in dKO mice, and single-knockout and dKO mice had similar blood K+ concentrations under this condition.","Also, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed an increase in the surface sodium channels (ENaC) and the potassium channel Ca2+-activated K+ channels BKCa."
27151921,"In conclusion, NDCBE is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and intravascular volume during salt depletion or NCC inactivation in mice.","When sodium-chloride is depleted, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice developed altered blood volume contraction, despite increased kidney activity."
27151921,"Furthermore, NDCBE has an important role in the prevention of hypokalemia.","Notably, the increase in aldosterone (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels) expected from the sodium-chloride loss was weakened in Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice."
27151921,"Because NCC and NDCBE are both thiazide targets, the combined inhibition of NCC and the NDCBE/pendrin system may explain thiazide-induced hypokalemia in some patients.",Single knock-out and Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice had similar blood potassium concentrations when this occurred.

33165964,Background: No clinical trials have been specifically designed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (PD).,No clinical trials with patients have been developed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination).
33165964,Objective: Study's objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa versus dopamine agonist monotherapy after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD.,"The objective of this study is to compare the performance and safety of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) versus dopamine agonist (a drug that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body) single therapy after deep brain stimulation (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain) in patients with Parkinson's disease."
33165964,"Methods: Thirty-five surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive postoperative monotherapy with either levodopa or dopamine agonist in a randomized, single-blind study.","In this study, 35 patients who are planning to undergo surgery are randomly assigned to receive either levodopa or dopamine agonist after surgery."
33165964,"All patients were reevaluated in short- (3 months), mid- (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up after surgery.","All patients are evaluated in short (3 months), mid (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up appointments after the surgery."
33165964,The primary outcome measure was the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3 months after surgery.,"The key outcome (result) researchers planned to evaluate is the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, a scale to count and measure severity of non-motor (unrelated to movement) symptoms such as pain and tiredness, 3 months after surgery."
33165964,"Secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients maintaining monotherapy, change in motor symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms (NMS).","A second outcome is the percent of patients staying on only one drug, change in motor (movement) symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms."
33165964,Analysis was performed primarily in the intention-to-treat population.,The analysis mainly focuses on the patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment.
33165964,"Results: Randomization did not significantly affect the primary outcome (difference in NMSS between treatment groups was 4.88 [95% confidence interval: -11.78-21.53, P = 0.566]).",Being randomly assigned into treatments did not significantly affect the key outcome from the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale between the two treatment groups.
33165964,"In short- and mid-term follow-up, monotherapy was safe and feasible in more than half of patients (60% in short- and 51.5% in mid-term follow-up), but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa.","In the 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments, single therapy (only one drug) is safe and practical in more than half of patients, but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa."
33165964,The ability to maintain dopamine agonist monotherapy was related to optimal contact location.,The ability to maintain dopamine agonist as the only treatment drug is related to the best contact location.
33165964,"In the long term, levodopa monotherapy was feasible only in a minority of patients (34.2%), whereas dopamine agonist monotherapy was not tolerated due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders.","In the 2.5 year follow-up, levodopa single therapy is feasible only in a small number of patients, whereas dopamine agonist single therapy is not tolerated (unable to handle side effects) due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders (disorders in which temptations or thoughts cannot be resisted)."
33165964,Conclusions: This trial provides evidence for simplifying pharmacological treatment after functional neurosurgery for PD.,"In conclusion, this study provides evidence for simplifying drug treatment after brain surgery for Parkinson's disease."
33165964,"The reduction in dopamine receptor agonists should be attempted while monitoring for occurrence of NMSs, such as apathy and sleep disturbances.","The reduction in dopamine agonists should be attempted while monitoring for development of non-motor symptoms, such as lack of motivation and sleep disturbances."

32804544,Introduction: Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with levodopa is hampered by motor complications related to the inability of residual nigrostriatal neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (DA) and use it appropriately.,"Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) is slowed down by motor (movement) complications related to the inability of neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement) and use it appropriately."
32804544,"This generated a tendency to postpone levodopa, favoring the initial use of DA agonists, which directly stimulate striatal dopaminergic receptors.","This problem often leads to delaying the use of levodopa and using dopamine agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine), which directly stimulates dopamine receptors or target sites in the brain."
32804544,"Use of DA agonists, however, is associated with multiple side effects and their efficacy is limited by suboptimal bioavailability.","Using dopamine agonists, however, is connected with multiple side effects."
32804544,"Areas covered: This paper reviewed the latest preclinical and clinical findings on the efficacy and adverse effects of non-ergot DA agonists, discussing the present and future of this class of compounds in PD therapy.",Their performance is limited by the drug not being completely available to the intended part of the body.
32804544,"Expert opinion: The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of DA agonists as initial treatment or adjunctive therapy to levodopa in advanced PD, but a more conservative approach to their use is emerging, due to the complexity and repercussions of their side effects.","This paper reviews the latest findings from animal and human studies on the performance and negative effects of non-ergot dopamine agonists (newer types of drugs that imitate the effects of dopamine), discussing the present and future of this type of drug in Parkinson's disease."
32804544,"As various factors may increase the individual risk to side effects, assessing such risk and calibrating the use of DA agonists accordingly may become extremely important in the clinical management of PD, as well as the availability of new DA agonists with better profiles of safety and efficacy.","The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of dopamine agonists as the first treatment and as an additional drug to use with levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease, but a more moderate approach to their use is emerging due to their side effects."
32721557,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease, has been linked to increased central and peripheral inflammation.","Parkinson's disease, the second most frequent brain disorder that impacts movement and coordination, is linked to increased central (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral (nerves) inflammation (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection)."
32721557,"Although the response of the immune system to dopaminergic treatment remains to be fully understood, dopaminergic agonists are known to exhibit immunoregulatory properties which may, at least in part, explain their therapeutic effect in PD.","Although the response of the immune system to dopamine drugs is not fully understood, dopaminergic agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine) are known to show immune system-regulating characteristics which may, at least in part, explain their effect in Parkinson's disease."
32721557,This highlights the need of analyzing immune parameters in longitudinal studies on PD patients receiving specific therapeutic regimes.,There is a need to analyze immune characteristics in long-term studies on Parkinson's disease patients who are receiving specific drugs.
32721557,"In this work, PD patients were included in a two-year prospective study comparing the effect of levodopa alone and a levodopa/pramipexole combo therapy on several regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cell populations.","In this study, patients with Parkinson's disease are included in a two-year prospective study (a study that takes a set number of subjects and follows them over a long period)."
32721557,"We demonstrated that PD patients show decreased circulating levels of several important regulatory subpopulations, as determined by flow cytometry.",This study compares the effect of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) alone and a combination of levodopa and pramipexole (dopamine-promoting) drugs on several regulating and pro-inflammatory (capable of causing inflammation) immune cells in the body.

34269321,Objective: A large number of people experience misophonia.,A large number of people experience misophonia (having a strong reaction to specific sounds).
34269321,"In 2013, the Amsterdam Study Group recommended diagnostic criteria for misophonia.","In 2013, the Amsterdam Study Group recommended criteria, such as signs and symptoms, to diagnose misophonia."
34269321,"However, misophonia is not yet included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.","However, misophonia is not yet included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a handbook for health care providers to guide the diagnosis of mental disorders."
34269321,This report is the first report on drug use that directly affects misophonia and demonstrates a 14-year-old adolescent girl with misophonia successfully treated with fluoxetine.,This report is the first report on drug use that directly affects misophonia and shows a 14-year old girl with misophonia who is successfully treated with fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac).
34269321,"Methods: The patient's misophonia symptoms had been continuing for approximately 2 years, and her quality of life was significantly reduced.","The patient's misophonia symptoms had been continuing for approximately 2 years, and her quality of life (a patient's ability to enjoy normal, everyday activities) was significantly reduced."
34269321,"Psychotherapy conditions could not be applied, and fluoxetine 10 mg/d was started and increased to 20 mg/d after a week.",Fluoxetine 10 mg/day was started and increased to 20 mg/day after a week.
34269321,"At the second-month follow-up, because of partial improvement, fluoxetine dose was increased to 30 mg/d.

12097783,"Objective: Although continuing antidepressant treatment after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, this risk is not eliminated.","Continuing treatment with antidepressants after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, which is when a medical condition that had previously improved starts to worsen."
12097783,A number of theories have been proposed to account for this apparent loss of efficacy.,"However, the risk of a relapse is not completely eliminated."
12097783,A common initial approach to managing relapse is to increase the dose of antidepressant.,A number of theories have been suggested to account for this possible decline in how well antidepressant medicines work.
12097783,We prospectively evaluated the likelihood of response to increasing the fluoxetine doses in patients relapsing during a long-term efficacy study of two fluoxetine dosing regimens.,A common first approach to help a patient who is relapsing is to increase the dose of the antidepressant medicine.
12097783,Method: Patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with modified HAMD17 scores > or =18 and CGI-severity scores > or =4 were treated for 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine in a multicenter US study.,Researchers evaluated the chance patients will respond to an increase in the dose of fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) in patients relapsing during a long-term study of two different dosing plans of fluoxetine.
12097783,"Responders (n = 501) were randomized to 20 mg fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment.",Patients who have major depressive disorder are treated for 13 weeks with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine in a large US study.
12097783,"If the patients relapsed during the continuation phase, they were offered a 25-week optional rescue treatment phase during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day reinitiated, (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week.","The 501 patients who responded to the medicine are randomly put into either the group receiving 20 mg/day of fluoxetine, the group receiving sham treatment that has the appearance of the drug but is not the real medicine, or 90 mg of fluoxetine weekly."
12097783,The results of the rescue phase for the latter two groups who relapsed while on continuation treatment with fluoxetine are reported.,They will be in these groups for 25 weeks during a part of the study called the continuation phase.
12097783,Response was defined as a 50% reduction in the modified HAMD17 score since time of relapse and a CGI-severity score < or =2.,"If the patients relapse during the continuation phase, they are offered a different 25-week treatment plan called a rescue phase where the study medication dose is increased as 1) patients on placebo will restart fluoxetine at 20 mg/day, 2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day will have their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and 3) patients on the 90-mg weekly dose will have their dose increased to 90-mg twice a week."
12097783,Additional efficacy analyses included HAMD and CGI-severity changes from baseline to endpoint.,The results of the rescue phase the patients in group 2 (who received 20 mg/day) and group 3 (who received the 90-mg weekly).
12097783,"Safety measures included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory measures.",Researchers used scoring tools that measure depression severity and seeing how much the depression scores are reduced since the time of the last relapse.
12097783,Results:,Additional analyses to evaluate how well the medicine worked include changes in these scoring tools from the start of the study to the end.
12097783,"Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the enteric-coated 90-mg-twice-weekly group).","Safety checks include assessment of unexpected side effects, vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, temperature), and tests done in a lab."
12097783,Mean modified HAMD17 scores decreased from a mean of approximately 20 to below 8 and were maintained for up to 6 months in the responders.,"Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment phase responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the 90-mg-twice-weekly group)."
12097783,Thirty-five percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after augmentation of medication.,The average score of the tool that measure depression severity decreased and was maintained for up to 6 months in the people who responded.
12097783,Conclusions: The patients relapsing after initially responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose.,There are 35 patients who either did not respond or responded at first but then relapsed after increasing medication.
12097783,These results also generally support increasing dose as a first-line treatment strategy for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant.,"In conclusion, patients who relapsed after first responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in the dose amount of fluoxetine."
12097783,Increasing enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appeared to be as well-tolerated and effective in restoring response as increasing a daily fluoxetine dose from 20 to 40 mg.,These results also generally support increasing the dose as a first-line treatment plan for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant.

1378369,This has implications in terms of potential drug interactions and must be considered when patients have to be switched to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.,This distinct effect duration may alter the drug's success and should be considered when switching patients' treatments.
1378369,"Studies with fluvoxamine have been conducted in both in- and outpatients, whereas trials with other SSRIs have been confined largely to outpatient populations.","Studies with fluvoxamine (an antidepressant SSRI) occured with patients in and out of hospitals, while studies with other SSRIs occured largely with patients out of hospitals."

18656819,"Hiatus hernia refers to conditions in which elements of the abdominal cavity, most commonly the stomach, herniate through the oesophageal hiatus into the mediastinum.",Hiatus hernia refers to when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest.
18656819,With the most common type (type I or sliding hiatus hernia) this is associated with laxity of the phrenooesophageal membrane and the gastric cardia herniates.,"The most common type (type 1 or sliding hiatus hernia), looseness of the ligament that attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm, causes the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus to push up."
18656819,"Sliding hiatus hernia is readily diagnosed by barium swallow radiography, endoscopy, or manometry when greater than 2 cm in axial span.","Sliding hiatus hernia is easily diagnosed by a swallowing test during x-ray, a flexible tube with a light and camera attached, or an esophagus test when more than 2 cm along an axis."
18656819,"However, the mobility of the oesophagogastric junction precludes the reliable detection of more subtle disruption by endoscopy or radiography.","However, the movement of the junction between the esophagus and stomach doesn't allow for dependable detection of smaller abnormalities using a flexible tube with a light and camera attached or x-ray."
18656819,"Detecting lesser degrees of axial separation between the lower oesophageal sphincter and crural diaphragm can only be reliably accomplished with high-resolution manometry, a technique that permits real time localization of these oesophagogastric junction components without swallow or distention related artefact.","Detecting lesser separation between the esophagus and the diaphragm can only be done reliably with a high-resolution esophagus test, which allows a real time location of the parts of the junction between the esophagus and stomach without misrepresentation due to movement."
29025426,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused by deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine.,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy.
29025426,"If left untreated, PKU results in increased phenylalanine concentrations in blood and brain, which cause severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems.","This is caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) that changes one molecule into another molecule."
29025426,PKU management differs widely across Europe and therefore these guidelines have been developed aiming to optimize and standardize PKU care.,"If not treated, PKU causes higher phenylalanine levels in the blood and brain, which causes intellectual disability, seizure disorder and behavioral problems."
31364419,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is considered to be a paradigm for a monogenic metabolic disorder but was never thought to be a primary application for human gene therapy due to established alternative treatment.,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a model of a disorder controlled by a single gene in which the body cannot properly turn some food into energy.
31364419,"However, somewhat unanticipated improvement in neuropsychiatric outcome upon long-term treatment of adults with PKU with enzyme substitution therapy might slowly change this assumption.","However, scientists didn't consider transferring genetic material into a PKU patient's cells due to other working treatments."
31364419,"In parallel, PKU was for a long time considered to be an excellent test system for experimental gene therapy of a Mendelian autosomal recessive defect of the liver due to an outstanding mouse model and the easy to analyze and well-defined therapeutic end point, that is, blood l-phenylalanine concentration.","However, unexpected mental function improvements after long-term treatment of adults with PKU by substituting a substance that is lacking in the PKU patient's body might change this belief."
31364419,"Lifelong treatment by targeting the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was achieved using different approaches, including (1) recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) or nonviral naked DNA vector-based gene addition, (2) genome editing using base editors delivered by rAAV vectors, and (3) by delivering rAAVs for promoter-less insertion of the PAH-cDNA into the Pah locus.","In the same way, PKU was thought to be a great test for trying to transfer genetic material into a patient's cells to help a liver disorder inherited from both parents due to a great mouse model and measurable blood levels of l-phenylalanine (a substance transformed by the missing protein in PKU)."
31364419,In this article we summarize the gene therapeutic attempts of correcting a mouse model for PKU and discuss the future implications for human gene therapy.,Lifelong treatment by focusing on the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was done using three different approaches.

16733942,"A drug interaction refers to an event in which the usual pharmacological effect of a drug is modified by other factors, most frequently additional drugs.","A drug interaction is when other things change the usual effects of a drug, most often other drugs."
16733942,"When two drugs are administered simultaneously, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can occur that may increase or decrease the intended magnitude or duration of the effect of one or both drugs.","When two drugs are taken at the same time, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can happen that may change the size or length of the effect of one or both drugs."
16733942,"Drugs may interact on a pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic basis.","Drugs may interact based on what the drugs do to each other (pharmaceutical), what the body does to the drugs (pharmacokinetic), and what the drugs do to the body (pharmacodynamic)."
16733942,Pharmacodynamic interactions arise when the alteration of the effects occurs at the site of action.,Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the change in effect happens at the site the drug works at in the body.
16733942,"This is a wide field where not only interactions between different drugs are considered but also drug and metabolites (midazolam/alpha-hydroxy-midazolam), enantiomers (ketamine), as well as phenomena such as tolerance (nordiazepam) and sensitization (diazepam).",Phamacodynamics is a wide field.
16733942,"Pharmacodynamic interactions can result in antagonism or synergism and can originate at a receptor level (antagonism, partial agonism, down-regulation, up-regulation), at an intraneuronal level (transduction, uptake), or at an interneuronal level (physiological pathways).",Pharmacodynamic interactions can cause drugs to work together or against each other and can happen at different levels of the body.
16733942,"Alternatively, psychotropic drug interactions assessed through quantitative pharmaco-EEG can be viewed according to the broad underlying objective of the study: safety-oriented (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), strictly pharmacologically-oriented (benzodiazepine receptors), or broadly neuro-physiologically-oriented (diazepam/buspirone).","Drugs that affect the mind, emotions, and behavior measured through a well known tool for finding and characterizing drug effects on the central nervous system (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) can be used based on the aim of the study: safety (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), drug properties (benzodiazepine receptors), or brain function (diazepam/buspirone)."
16733942,"Methodological issues are stressed, particularly drug plasma concentrations, dose-response relationships and time-course of effects (fluoxetine/buspirone), and unsolved questions are addressed (yohimbine/caffeine, hydroxizyne/alcohol).","We focus on methods, especially drug blood levels, response as a function of dosage, and varying activity of the drug over time (fluoxetine/buspirone) and talk about unsolved questions."
11097963,Objective: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (N=107) who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average duration of use=8.5 years) were enrolled in a benzodiazepine discontinuation program that assessed the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) compared to placebo in facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation.,We enrolled 107 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average length of use=8.5 years) in a program to discontinue benzodiazepines to measure how well other anxiety-reducing drugs like imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) helped patients wean or discontinue benzodiazepines compared to sugar pills.
11097963,"Method: After a benzodiazepine stabilization period taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients were treated for 4 weeks with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo under double-blind conditions while benzodiazepine intake was kept stable (treatment phase).","After a period to stabilize benzodiazepine levels taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients took imipramine, buspirone, or sugar pills for 4 weeks while the amount of benzodiazepines taken were kept the same (treatment phase)."
11097963,"Patients then entered a 4-6 week benzodiazepine taper and a 5-week posttaper phase with imipramine, buspirone, and placebo treatment being continued until 3 weeks into the posttaper phase, at which time all patients were switched to placebo for 2 weeks.","Patients then slowly decreased the amount of benzodiazepines taken for 4-6 weeks, took imipramine, buspirone, and sugar pills for the next 3 weeks, and then took sugar pills for 2 weeks."
11097963,Benzodiazepine plasma levels were assayed weekly.,Blood benzodiazepine levels were measured weekly using a common lab test.
11097963,Benzodiazepine-free status was assessed 3 and 12 months posttaper.,We measured how many patients no longer had benzodiazepine in their blood 3 and 12 months after the last sugar pill.
11097963,Results:,Study participants had used benzodiazepines for a long time and had tried an average of three times to decrease the amount of benzodiazepines taken.
11097963,Study subjects were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three unsuccessful prior taper attempts.,"Patients who took imipramine were significantly more successful in decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken (82.6%), nonsignificantly more successful regarding patients who took buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who took sugar pills (37.5%)."
11097963,"The success rate of the taper in this study was significantly higher for patients who received imipramine (82.6%), and nonsignificantly higher for patients who received buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who received placebo (37.5%).","Imipramine helped even after factoring in other factors to weaning success: amount of benzodiazepines taken, level of anxious feelings prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken."
11097963,"The imipramine effect remained highly significant even after the analysis adjusted for three other independent predictors of taper success: benzodiazepine dose, level of anxious symptoms at baseline, and duration of benzodiazepine therapy.",We concluded that discontinuing benzodiazepines can be done more easily by giving patients imipramine before and during the process of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken over time.
11097963,Conclusions: Management of benzodiazepine discontinuation can be facilitated significantly by co-prescribing imipramine before and during the benzodiazepine taper.,"Amount of benzodiazepines taken daily, level of anxiety and depression prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken also predicted success of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken."
11097963,Objective: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (N=107) who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average duration of use=8.5 years) were enrolled in a benzodiazepine discontinuation program that assessed the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) compared to placebo in facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation.,107 patients with diagnosed anxiety and who used anxiety-reducing benzodiazepine drugs (for 8.5 years on average) entered a program that ended their drug use.
11097963,"Method: After a benzodiazepine stabilization period taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients were treated for 4 weeks with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo under double-blind conditions while benzodiazepine intake was kept stable (treatment phase).",The program measured how antidepressant imipramine (180 mg/day) and anxiety-reducing busprione (38 mg/day) helps end benzodiazepine use compared to inactive treatment.
11097963,"Patients then entered a 4-6 week benzodiazepine taper and a 5-week posttaper phase with imipramine, buspirone, and placebo treatment being continued until 3 weeks into the posttaper phase, at which time all patients were switched to placebo for 2 weeks.","After using either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam (anxiety-reducing benzodiazepines) for a period of time, patients used imipramine, busprione, or an inactive placebo for 4 weeks while benzodiazepine usage was stable."
11097963,Benzodiazepine plasma levels were assayed weekly.,"For 4-6 weeks, patients lessened benzodiazepine use."
11097963,Benzodiazepine-free status was assessed 3 and 12 months posttaper.,"Then, for 5 weeks, patients kept using imipramine, busiprone, and inactive treatment until 3 weeks in this 5-week phase, at which all patients switched to inactive treatment for 2 weeks."
11097963,Results:,Benzodiazepine blood levels were measured weekly.
11097963,Study subjects were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three unsuccessful prior taper attempts.,Benzodiazepine-free status was checked 3 and 12 months after treatment.
11097963,"The success rate of the taper in this study was significantly higher for patients who received imipramine (82.6%), and nonsignificantly higher for patients who received buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who received placebo (37.5%).",Patients were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three failed attempts to lessen drug use.
11097963,"The imipramine effect remained highly significant even after the analysis adjusted for three other independent predictors of taper success: benzodiazepine dose, level of anxious symptoms at baseline, and duration of benzodiazepine therapy.",Success rate for lessening drug use was higher for patients taking imipramine (82.6%) and not much higher for patients taking buspirone (67.9%) compared to patients taking the inactive placebo (37.5%).
11097963,Conclusions: Management of benzodiazepine discontinuation can be facilitated significantly by co-prescribing imipramine before and during the benzodiazepine taper.,"The imipramine effect was still high even after accounting for benzodiazepine dose, baseline level of anxious symptoms, and duration of benzodiazepine treatment."
11097963,"Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression, and duration of benzodiazepine use were additional significant predictors of successful taper outcome.",Ending benzodiazepine drug use can be helped by using imipramine before and during the period of benzodiazepine drug use reduction.
9600581,"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 10-week trial, the anxiolytic properties of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone were compared with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and placebo in 125 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-III.","Over 10 weeks, we compared the anti-anxiety drug characteristics of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and sugar pills in 125 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders."
9600581,"After a 3- to 7-day wash-out period, patients were allocated at random to receive orally 3 x 5 mg buspirone (n=58), 3 x 1 mg lorazepam (n=57), or placebo (n=10) over a 4-week period.","After a 3- to 7-day period for the body to eliminate drugs in the system, patients were randomly given 5 mg buspirone 3 times a day (58 patients), 1 mg lorazepam 3 times a day (57 patients), or sugar pills (10 patients) for four weeks."
9600581,The study also comprised a 2-week taper period and a 4-week placebo-control period to assess the stability of clinical improvement.,The study also included a 2-week period when drug amounts were slowly decreased and a 4-week period when all patients took sugar pills to measure the consistency of improvements in anxiety symptoms.
9600581,The patient's clinical state was estimated on entry and at weekly intervals by general practitioners using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment and by a self-rating scale (State Trait Anxiety Inventory X2=STAI-X2).,Doctors estimated severity of anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the study and weekly using common questionnaires.
9600581,"Lorazepam treatment resulted in descriptively, but not significantly, greater improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety during the whole treatment (week 0-4) and taper period (week 5, 6) than did buspirone.","Patients taking lorazepam showed slightly greater improvement in symptoms than those taking buspirone on one of the questionnaires during the whole treatment (weeks 0-4) and when drug amounts were slowly decreased (weeks 5,6), though not significantly."
9600581,"After treatment with active drugs had been discontinued, the 4-week placebo control period showed buspirone-treated patients to display a stability of clinical improvement, while the symptoms of lorazepam-treated patients worsened at week 7-10.","After patients stopped taking the studied drugs, the 4-week period when patients took sugar pills showed patients who took buspirone showed consistent improvements in anxiety symptoms, while patients who took lorazepam showed worse symptoms at weeks 7-10."
9600581,"Both buspirone and lorazepam were more efficacious in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo during the treatment and taper period; however, in contrast to the active drugs (buspirone, lorazepam), patients of the placebo group showed further clinical improvement during the control period, especially in the HAM-A score, so differences between placebo and active drugs became smaller at the end of the study.",Both buspirone and lorazepam worked better than sugar pills to improve anxiety symptoms during treatment and when drug amounts were slowly decreased.
10901839,This multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and consequences of progressive or abrupt withdrawal of clobazam in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in a double blind study in comparison to lorazepam and buspirone.,"We rated the effectiveness and effects of gradual or fast withdrawal of clobazam (a benzodiazepine which helps treat anxiety) in treating generalized anxiety disorder compared to lorazepam and buspirone, other anxiety-treating drugs."

10901839,The dosages were increased progressively during the first week of treatment.,The amount taken was increased gradually during the first week of treatment.
10901839,"At the end of this time, the patients received either 30 mg clobazam or 30 mg buspirone or 3 mg lorazepam daily.","At the end of this time, the patients took either 30 mg clobazam, 30 mg buspirone, or 3 mg lorazepam every day."
10901839,"After the first week, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) showed a significant improvement in clobazam and lorazepam groups but not in buspirone group.","After the first week, a common questionnaire measuring severity of anxiety symptoms showed improvement in people taking clobazam and lorazepam but not in people taking buspirone."
10901839,All the drugs were equally effective after three weeks of treatment.,All the drugs worked equally well after three weeks of treatment.
10901839,"The anti-anxiety activity persisted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, without any signs of rebound anxiety or withdrawal syndrome.","The anti-anxiety effects lasted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, with no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms."
10901839,No clinically relevant differences were found between the 4 groups regarding safety.,We found no relevant difference in safety between the 4 groups.
10901839,"The side-effects reported were mainly drowsiness in clobazam and lorazepam groups, nausea and headache in buspirone group.",Drowsiness in patients taking clobazam and lorazepam and nausea and headache in patients taking buspirone were the main side effects reported.
10901839,"In conclusion, clobazam like lorazepam improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of therapy, efficacy was comparable with the 3 drugs and persisted after treatment discontinuation.","We conclude that clobazam, like lorazepam, improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of treatment, effectiveness of the 3 drugs was similar and lasted after patients stopped taking the drugs."
8588056,1,"This study's purpose was to compare the effects and sudden termination of buspirone 15 or 20 mg three times a day and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg three times a day, common anxiety-reducing drugs."

8588056,This study confirmed that buspirone was as effective as lorazepam at D56 in monitored outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder.,Buspirone may have differed in effectiveness compared to lorazepam for treating certain physical symptoms common with anxiety disorder.
7714222,"Forty-four patients with DSM-III-R generalized anxiety disorder participated in this double-blind, randomized study.",We studied 44 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
7714222,Patients were on a benzodiazepine before the study and were stabilized on 3 to 5 mg/day lorazepam for 5 weeks (weeks 0 to 5).,"Patients were taking a benzodiazepine before the study and were stabilized on 3 to 5 mg/day lorazepam for 5 weeks (weeks 0-5), both anxiety-reducing drugs."

7714222,Side effects were assessed through the Dosage Treatment Emergent Symptoms at the same times.,"At the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, we measured severity of anxiety symptoms using common questionnaires."
7714222,"The benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome was evaluated through a 27-symptom checklist (Clinical-Rated Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Schedule) at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13.","At the same times, we measured side effects using another questionnaire."
7714222,The results showed that buspirone was more effective than placebo and comparable to lorazepam.,"At the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13, we measured withdrawal symptoms using a common checklist."
7714222,Buspirone-treated patients showed no rebound anxiety or benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome compared with placebo.,The results favored buspirone over sugar pills and were similar to lorazepam.
7714222,Buspirone caused fewer side effects than lorazepam and was not different from placebo in this respect.,Patients taking buspirone showed no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms compared to sugar pills.
7714222,"Finally, buspirone maintained its anxiolytic effect for at least 2 weeks after the discontinuation of treatment.","Buspirone, similar to sugar pills, caused fewer side effects than lorazepam."
8095725,"The respiratory and behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) were determined alone and in combination with buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in rhesus monkeys.","We studied effects on breathing and behavior of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR; a molecule that receives signals for a cell) inverse agonist (a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist or stimulating molecule but causes an opposite response) ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) alone and with the anxiety-reducing drugs of buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in monkeys."
8095725,"For the respiratory studies, one group of monkeys inhaled either air or 5% CO2 mixed in air according to a fixed alternating schedule; respiratory frequency and minute volume were monitored.","For the breathing-related studies, one group of monkeys breathed air or 5% CO2 mixed in air; breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed were measured."
8095725,"For the behavioral studies, another group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio (FR 30) schedule of food presentation.","For the behavior studies, another group of monkeys responded to food given every thirty seconds."
8095725,"The respiratory stimulant effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were enhanced by prior treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg).","The increased breathing effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were increased by previously taking the drugs of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg)."
8095725,Coadministration of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of beta-CCE under the FR schedule.,Taking buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) at the same time also increased effects of beta-CCE under the food schedule.
8095725,"The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on respiratory frequency and minute volume particularly under the 5% CO2 condition, and lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on FR responding.",The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed especially under the 5% CO2 condition.
8095725,These latter results show that the respiratory and behavioral effects of beta-CCE in rhesus monkeys are at least in part due to effects at BZRs.,Lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on behavior responding on the food schedule.
8095725,"Moreover, the findings suggest either that coactivation of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites lead to a greater than additive effect or that beta-CCE and buspirone share a common mechanism of action that is unrelated to the receptor at which BZR inverse agonists act.",These latter results shows that effects on breathing and behavior of beta-CCE in monkeys are at least due to effects at BZRs.

34555986,Introduction: Treatments for subjects with Covid-19 are required.,"Treatments for people with COVID-19, a viral breathing-related disorder, are needed."
34555986,One approach is neutralising monoclonal antibodies.,"One option is to use monoclonal antibodies, which are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce."
34555986,Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.,Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are two types of monoclonal antibodies.
34555986,"Areas covered: This evaluation is of the phase 3 BLAZE-1 clinical trial, which was of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adult ambulatory participants with a risk factor for, and mild to moderate, Covid-19 illness.",This evaluation is of the 3rd phase of a clinical study called BLAZE that examines bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adults.
34555986,"The primary outcome was Covid 19 related hospitalisation of ??? 24 hours or death from any cause by day 29, and this occurred in 2.1% subjects in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group.",The main result researchers look for is COVID-19 related hospital stays that lasted at least 24 hours or death.
34555986,"Expert opinion: In the pandemic, the attempts by the FDA to shorten approval processes for medicines and by journals to make information available in a timely manner are admirable.","This result occurred in 2.1% of patients in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group."
34555986,"However, these shortened processes made negotiating the details of BLAZE-1 and producing accurate and critical appraisals difficult.","Based on opinions of experts, the FDA's efforts to shorten the approval process for medicines and for medical journals to make information available is admirable."
34555986,"It seems to me, that if there are any benefits of bamlanivimab alone in Covid-19, they are not clear-cut.","However, these shortened processes make the details of the BLAZE study and producing accurate reviews difficult."
34555986,Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants and is not effective against the delta variant.,"It seems that if there are any benefits for bamlanivimab alone in COVID-19, they are not clear-cut."
34555986,"Thus, the benefits of bamlanivimab/etesevimab in the phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 may be solely due to etesevimab, and this needs to be tested.",Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants of COVID-19 and is not effective against the delta variant.
34552950,"Over 80 mAbs have been shown to block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein and its cellular receptor, thus neutralizing virus infectivity in vitro.","Over 80 monoclonal antibody medicines have been shown to block the interaction between the coronavirus glycoprotein (a molecule that has a carbohydrate and a protein) and its cell receptor that can send signals, resulting in making the virus ineffective."
34552950,Some of those mAbs demonstrate therapeutic efficacy to curtail viral burden and lung inflammation in animal models.,"The coronavirus causes COVID-1, a viral breathing-related disorder, and monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells."
34552950,"The neutralization mechanisms of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo are not fully understood, but optimal protection correlates with Fc effector functions.",Some of those monoclonal antibodies show that they work well to reduce the effects of the virus and lung inflammation (redness and swelling in response to infection) in animal studies.
34552950,Approximately 30 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing m,"The process used by monoclonal antibodies to make the virus ineffective in humans and animals is not fully understood, but the best protection is associated with the Fc effector functions, which are the part of the antibody that interacts with other cells."
34552950,Abs are undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.,Approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.
34552950,"Some were granted emergency authorization since they reduced viral load, disease severity, and hospitalization in randomized, controlled phase II clinical trials.","Some are granted emergency authorization (where unapproved medicines may be used) because they reduce the amount of virus in the body, lessen the seriousness of the disease, and reduce hospital stays in clinical trials."
34552950,"However, mAbs are unaffordable for healthcare systems in many developing countries due to their high cost (> USD 1,500/vial), meaning that most infected people would not have access to them.","However, monoclonal antibodies are expensive for healthcare systems in many developing countries, meaning that most infected people would not have access to the medicine."
34552950,Another obstacle for COVID-19 therapy with mAbs is the emergence of viral variants harboring changes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 glycoprotein.,Another challenge for COVID-19 medicines that use monoclonal antibodies is the new variants that change cell receptor activity for the glycoprotein.
34552950,"The variants of concern (VoC) exhibit enhanced transmissibility or virulence, circulate worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta, first detected in the UK, South Africa, Brazil, USA, and India, respectively.","The variants of concern are more easily transmitted between people, are found worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta."
34552950,"Therapeutic mAbs, and antibodies in the plasma of vaccinated or convalescent individuals, fail to neutralize VoC efficiently.","Monoclonal antibody medicines, and antibodies in plasma (the liquid portion of blood) of vaccinated or recovering people, fail to efficiently make the variants of interest ineffective."
34552949,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern show reduced neutralization by vaccine-induced and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies; therefore, treatment alternatives are needed.","Coronavirus variants of concern (variants that are easier to transmit and/or are more severe) show reduced effect from monoclonal antibodies which are drugs that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce."
34552949,"We tested therapeutic equine polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) that are being assessed in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta, using plaque reduction neutralization assays.","Researchers tested equine or horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (antibody drugs that attack several parts of the COVID-19 virus) that are being tested in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta."
34552949,"We show that equine pAbs efficiently neutralize the variants of concern, with inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.146-1.078 ??g/mL, which correspond to extremely low concentrations when compared to pAbs doses used in clinical trials.",The results show that equine polyclonal antibodies efficiently make the variant of concern ineffective.
34552949,"Equine pAbs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost and a scalable COVID-19 treatment.","Equine polyclonal antibodies are found to be an effective, low-cost, and accessible COVID-19 treatment for the variants of concern."
34552949,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern show reduced neutralization by vaccine-induced and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies; therefore, treatment alternatives are needed.",Alarming variants of SARS-CoV-2 (a viral respiratory disease) show reduced elimination by vaccine-induced and highly-specific antibodies.
34552949,"We tested therapeutic equine polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) that are being assessed in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta, using plaque reduction neutralization assays.","Thus, different treatments are needed."
34552949,"We show that equine pAbs efficiently neutralize the variants of concern, with inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.146-1.078 ??g/mL, which correspond to extremely low concentrations when compared to pAbs doses used in clinical trials.","We tested horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), a mixture of antibodies that bind to the same foreign organism."
34552949,"Equine pAbs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost and a scalable COVID-19 treatment.","These pAbs are being measured in Costa Rica against five alarming, global variants: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta."
34547765,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated clinical benefit in cases of mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, substantially reducing the risk for hospitalization and severe disease 1-4.","Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that can make the coronavirus ineffective and have shown to be beneficial in cases of mild to moderate coronavirus infection, substantially reducing the risk for staying in the hospital and having severe symptoms of the disease."
34547765,Treatment generally requires the administration of high doses of these mAbs with limited efficacy in preventing disease complications or mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients 5.,"The coronavirus can cause COVID-19, the viral breathing-related infection."
34547765,Here we report the development and evaluation of Fc-optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with superior potency to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.,Treatment usually requires high doses of these monoclonal antibodies with limited ability in preventing complications or death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
34547765,"In several animal models of COVID-19 disease we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating Fc??Rs results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge and treatment of pre-infected animals.",This study reports on the development and evaluation of monoclonal antibodies enhanced with the Fc (the part of the antibody that helps interactions with other cells) to prevent or treat COVID-19.
34547765,"Our results highlight the importance of Fc??R pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity, while excluding any pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of Fc??R engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection.","In several animal studies of COVID-19, researchers show that activating certain parts of the Fc proteins results in improvements in both preventing and treating weight loss and death from the disease."
34547765,These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered mAbs with optimal Fc effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease.,This helps reduce the dose required to gain full protection in animals who are not infected with the coronavirus.
34541573,The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants has posed a serious global public health emergency.,The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus (the virus that causes COVID-19 or the breathing-related infection) and its variants has created a global public health emergency.
34541573,Therapeutic interventions or vaccines are urgently needed to treat and prevent the further dissemination of this contagious virus.,Medical drugs and vaccines are needed to treat and prevent the spread of this contagious virus.
34541573,This study described the identification of neutralizing receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies from mice through vaccination with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD.,This study describes how antibodies that are linked to receptor-binding domains (parts of the cell that connect the virus and allow entry to the cell) are identified in mice using a vaccine that includes a small piece of DNA or genetic material to teach the body to fight the infection.
34541573,RBD-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with distinct function and epitope recognition were selected to understand SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.,"Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce."
34541573,High-affinity RBD-specific antibodies exhibited high potency in neutralizing both live and pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle containing the spike protein S-RBDV367F mutant (SARS-CoV-2(V367F)).,Certain monoclonal antibodies are selected for the study to understand how the coronavirus can be made ineffective.
34541573,These results demonstrated that these antibodies recognize four distinct groups (I-IV) of epitopes on the RBD and that mAbs targeting group I epitope can be used in combination with mAbs recognizing groups II and/or IV epitope to make mAb cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants.,Some antibodies with these receptor-binding domains have a high ability to make the coronavirus ineffective.
34541573,"Moreover, structural characterization reveals that groups I, III, and IV epitopes are closely located to an RBD hotspot.",These results show that monoclonal antibodies targeting certain parts of the virus can be used in combination with other monoclonal antibodies medicines against the coronavirus.
34541573,The identification of RBD-specific antibodies and cocktails may provide an effective therapeutic and prophylactic intervention against SARS-CoV-2 and its isolates.,The identification of these antibodies linked to receptor-binding domains and the mix of medicines may provide effective treatment and prevention against coronavirus.

34577851,Background and Objectives.,Mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body.
34577851,"The importance of mitochondria in inflammatory pathologies, besides providing energy, is associated with the release of mitochondrial damage products, such as mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), which may perpetuate inflammation.",These roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection).
34577851,"In this review, we aimed to show the importance of mitochondria, as organelles that produce energy and intervene in multiple pathologies, focusing mainly in COVID-19 and using multiple molecular mechanisms that allow for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome, leading to the exacerbation and spread of the inflammatory response.",The event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage.
34577851,"The evidence suggests that mitochondria are implicated in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which forms double-membrane vesicles and evades detection by the cell defense system.",One of these products is mitochondrial DNA which can increase inflammation within the body.
34577851,"These mitochondrion-hijacking vesicles damage the integrity of the mitochondrion's membrane, releasing mt-DNA into circulation and triggering the activation of innate immunity, which may contribute to an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory state.","This review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease)."

34562551,Anti-viral T cell exhaustion in the early stages is associated with disease progression.,Each person's unique immune response will likely determine and predict how a patient will react to infection.
34562551,"Dysregulation of T cell functions, which precedes cytokine storm development and neutrophil expansion in alveolar tissues heralds damaging pathology.","Therefore, each person's immune system represents a target for intervention to prevent harmful side effects."
34562551,"T cell function, cytokine production and factors that attract neutrophils to the lung can be modified through targeting molecules that can modulate T cell responses.","In the early stages of infection, exhausted or overworked T cells (an immune system cell) can lead to disease progression."

34562551,Targeting this signalling pathway also has potential to prevent formation of thrombi due to its role in platelet activation.,"Manipulating T cell responses could provide the means to control the immune response in patients with COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disorder)."
34562551,"Furthermore, this signalling pathway is essential for SARS-cov-2 virus replication in host cells and its inhibition could, therefore, reduce viral load.","During the initial anti-viral response, T cell function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion by suppressing certain biological pathways."
34562551,The ultimate goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome.,"Additionally, immune dysregulation or errors can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting molecules that control cell metabolism."
34562551,Targeting different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway could potentially achieve this during each stage of the disease.,Targeting cell metabolism pathways may also prevent formation of blood clots.

8784216,"GBP was about as potent as phenytoin in the maximal electroshock test, but had a different profile of efficacy than standard antiepileptics in a range of animal models.",Gabapentin has performed differently than other standard drugs that are used to prevent seizures in a number of animal experiments.
8784216,"Possible mechanisms of action include biochemical effects enhancing the ratio of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to glutamate, ion-channel actions (direct or indirect), and/ or enhancement of nonsynaptic GABA release.",Possible processes that lead the drug to have an effect include the response of increasing the development of neurotransmitters (signaling molecules in the brain) and other cell functions.
8784216,"The anticonvulsant effect appears to depend on concentration of gabapentin in neurons, presumably by the L-system amino acid transporter that has been implicated in absorption from the gut.",The act of stopping or slowing the excessive rapid firing of neurons (brain cells) during seizures seems to depend on the concentration of gabapentin in neurons.
8784216,Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggested a direct relationship of clinical response to dose and efficacy did not plateau at the doses used.,Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggest a direct relationship of medical response to the dose and success did not level-off at the doses used.
8784216,"The maximally effective dose, relationship of efficacy to blood level, and maximum tolerable dose are not yet known conclusively.","The maximally effective dose (the dose at which any higher dose would not lead to improvement), the relationship of its performance to blood level, and the maximum tolerable dose (the highest dose most people can handle) are not completely known."

28676198,Gabapentin is almost exclusively cleared by the kidney and thus presents challenges in patients with kidney failure.,The nerve-related pain medication gabapentin is cleared from the body almost entirely by the kidney.
28676198,"Gabapentin is known to be effectively cleared by hemodialysis, but the efficiency of clearance by peritoneal dialysis (PD) has not been previously described.","Because of this, patients with kidney failure face a challenge."
28676198,We report a case of gabapentin toxicity in a patient on long-term PD who was treated with continuous automated cycling PD.,"Gabapentin is known to be effectively cleared by hemodialysis, a process of using machines to clean the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally, but how well peritoneal dialysis (PD), a process that filters blood using the inside lining of the stomach, clears the drug has not been previously described."
28676198,We find that continuous PD provides significant clearance of gabapentin.,"Researchers describe a case of too much gabapentin in a patient with long-term peritoneal dialysis who is treated with continuous automated cycling peritoneal dialysis, which is when a mechanical device filters the blood at night while sleeping."

28676198,"Further, our patient's symptoms of gabapentin toxicity gradually improved and had fully resolved after about 36 hours of dialysis.","The documented elimination half-life (the time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or body to be reduced by half) is 41.33 hours, which is much shorter than the 132 hours reported in other studies in the absence of kidney function."
28676198,Gabapentin clearance by PD was estimated at 94% of urea clearance.,"In addition, the patient's symptoms of gabapentin toxicity (often muscle weakness, drowsiness, and drooping eyelids) improved and fully resolved after about 36 hours of dialysis."
28676198,We conclude that intensive PD provides gabapentin clearance that approximates that of urea and is an effective but slow method to treat gabapentin overdose and toxicity.,Gabapentin clearance in the body by peritoneal dialysis is estimated at 94% of urea (or waste protein) clearance.

22256806,BACKGROUND:,"Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to measure how much calcium and other minerals are in bones to look for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) is suggested for women 65 years old or older, few studies look at how long to wait between tests."
22256806,"Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to screen for osteoporosis (BMD T score, ???2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between BMD tests.","We studied 4957 women, 67 years old and older, with normal BMD or weaker than normal bones who had never broken a hip or spine or received treatment for osteoporosis, followed for up to 15 years."
22256806,METHODS:,"The time between BMD testing was the estimated time for 10% of women to develop osteoporosis before breaking a hip or spine, considering estrogen (female-specific hormone) use and risk factors."
22256806,"We studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal BMD (T score at the femoral neck and total hip, ???1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (T score, ???1.01 to ???2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis, followed prospectively for up to 15 years.","We used mathematical models to look at changes from normal BMD and from mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia."
22256806,"The BMD testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors.",We considered hip and spine breaks and people taking drugs to strengthen bones.
22256806,"Transitions from normal BMD and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed with the use of parametric cumulative incidence models.","We found the estimated time between BMD testing was 16.8 years for women with normal BMD and 17.3, 4.7. and 1.1 years for women with mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia, respectively."
22256806,"Incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks.","Our results suggest that less than 10% of older women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) would develop osteoporosis if tested about every 15 years for women with normal BMD or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia."
23000664,The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline for osteoporosis screening concludes that there is a lack of evidence about optimal rescreening intervals and states that intervals >2 years may be necessary to better predict fracture risk.,Current expert panel guidance for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) testing states that not enough data exist on the best period of time in between tests and that periods of over 2 years may be needed to better predict the risk of breaking bones.
23000664,"In addition, the USPSTF cites a prospective study showing that repeat measurement of BMD after 8 years added little predictive value compared with baseline DEXA scan results.","In addition, the guidance mentions a study showing that measuring BMD after 8 years only helped a small amount to predict osteoporosis compared with initial BMD scan results."

29946735,The screening population was postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis.,"The expert panel looked at scientific studies on checking for and treatment of bone breaks due to osteoporosis in men and women, and tools to measure risk, periods between checks, and how well checks and treatment work in smaller groups."
29946735,Findings:,The group that was checked for osteoporosis was women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men who had never had a known bone break due to osteoporosis and no known conditions or drug use known to cause osteoporosis.
29946735,The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men.,The expert panel found strong proof that bone measurement tests are correct for finding osteoporosis and predicting bone breaks due to osteoporosis in women and men.
29946735,The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures.,The expert panel found some proof that tools to measure risk are somewhat correct in finding risk of osteoporosis and bone breaks due to osteoporosis.
29946735,The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women.,The expert panel found strong proof that drugs decrease later bone break rates in women who have gone through menopause.
29946735,The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures.,The expert panel found there is not enough proof to measure how well drugs work to decrease later bone break rates in men without previous bone breaks.
29946735,Conclusions and recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older.,The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women 65 years and older.

28634907,Background: Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking.,"Current guidelines disagree or do not exist for how long to wait between checks and treatment check-ins involving the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, a technique used by doctors to measure a patient's risk of osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle)."
28634907,The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening.,"A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures does not suggest DXA scans within 2 years of the first test."
28634907,It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use.,How often and for which patient characteristics doctors order repeat scans is unclear.

28634907,"Main measures: Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA.","For women not treated after a first DXA, 2-year amounts for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women were 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after the first screening."
28634907,"Key results: Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening.","For treated women, average time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups."
28634907,"For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups.","Compared to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly led to repeat screening for untreated women but not within the treated group."
28634907,"Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40-2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91-1.30)].","Conclusions: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, with a large amount of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening."

26458388,"Methods: One thousand five hundred seventy-two men aged ???65 years in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study completed bone mineral density (BMD) testing and a battery of laboratory measures, including serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-OH vitamin D, total testosterone, spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio, spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio, creatinine-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate, 24-h urine calcium, and 24-h urine free cortisol.","We studied 1,572 men 65 years old and older who has bone mineral density (BMD) testing and many other lab measurements."
26458388,"Using cross-sectional analyses, we calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association of any and specific laboratory abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to identify one additional laboratory abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis.",We checked for links of any lab abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to find one more lab abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis.
26458388,Results: Approximately 60 % of men had ???1 laboratory abnormality in both men with and without osteoporosis.,We found that about 60% of men with and without osteoporosis had one or more lab abnormality.
26458388,"Among individual tests, only vitamin D insufficiency (PR, 1.13; 95 % CI, 1.05-1.22) and high alkaline phosphatase (PR, 3.05; 95 % CI, 1.52-6.11) were more likely in men with osteoporosis.","Among lab tests, only not enough vitamin D and high alkaline phosphatase (suggesting damage to liver or bone disorder) were more likely in men with osteoporosis."
26458388,Hypercortisolism and hyperthyroidism were uncommon and not significantly more frequent in men with osteoporosis.,Too much cortisol (stress hormone) and overactive thyroid (metabolism-regulating hormone) were rare and not meaningfully more common in men with osteoporosis.
26458388,No osteoporotic men had hypercalciuria.,No men with osteoporosis had high levels of calcium in the urine.
26458388,"Conclusions: Though most of these older men had ???1 laboratory abnormality, few routinely recommended individual tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without osteoporosis.","Though most of these older men had one or more lab abnormality, few often-recommended tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without."
26458388,"Possibly excepting vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, benefit of routine laboratory testing to identify possible secondary causes in older osteoporotic men appears low.","Except for possibly vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, usefulness of routine lab testing to find possible underlying causes in older men with osteoporosis seems low."
26458388,Results may not be generalizable to younger men or to older men in whom history and exam findings raise clinical suspicion for a secondary cause of osteoporosis.,Results may not apply to younger men or to older men thought to have osteoporosis from underlying causes.
26280231,Osteoporosis-related fractures affect approximately one in two white women and one in five white men in their lifetime.,Bone breaks due to osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) happen in about 50% of white women and 20% of white men in their lifetime.
26280231,"The impact of fractures includes loss of function, significant costs, and increased mortality.","Bone breaks cause loss of physical function, high costs, and increased death."
26280231,"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to screen all women 65 years and older, and younger women who have an increased fracture risk as determined by the World Health Organization's FRAX Fracture Risk Assessment Tool.","An expert panel recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, or bone density scanning, to check all women 65 year and older, and younger women who are more likely to have bone breaks based on a popular measurement tool to measure fracture risk."
26280231,"Although guidelines are lacking for rescreening women who have normal bone mineral density on initial screening, intervals of at least four years appear safe.","Although there are not guidelines for rechecking women who have initial normal bone mineral density, four years between checks looks safe."
26280231,The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening for osteoporosis in men; other organizations recommend screening all men 70 years and older.,The expert panel did not find enough proof to recommend checking for osteoporosis in men; other groups recommend checking all men 70 years and older.
26280231,"In patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis, suggested laboratory tests to identify secondary causes include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone.","In people with newly found osteoporosis, lab tests to find underlying causes include measuring blood levels of different substances."
26280231,"First-line treatment to prevent fractures consists of fall prevention, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and bisphosphonate therapy.","The best treatment to prevent breaks includes preventing falls, stopping smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning."
26280231,Clinicians should consider discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy after five years in women without a personal history of vertebral fractures.,Doctors should think about stopping a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning after five years in women without a history of spine breaks.
26280231,"Raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab are alternative effective treatments for certain subsets of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition does not respond to bisphosphonates.",Other types of drugs for osteoporosis exist for certain groups of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition is not helped by one group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning.
26280231,The need for follow-up bone mineral density testing in patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis is uncertain.,The need to recheck bone mineral density in people taking drugs for osteoporosis is unknown.

34486178,"Here we show that enhanced PC2 expression is a common feature of PKD1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA.",This suggests that the number of PC1 and PC2 proteins needs to be stable within a brief time period to prevent the formation of cysts.
34486178,"However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2.","In this study, researchers show that more cells and proteins from PC2 is a common feature of PKD1 changes, in part because of an increase in PKD2."
34486178,"We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones.","However, this data also suggests that more effective protein folding, which is when a protein changes from a long chain to a functional shape, contributes to more levels of PC2 proteins."

28346013,High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump.,Blood volume is progressively decreased to the point of critically low blood pressure.
28346013,"When the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue.",This test approach has shown differences in the bodily responses between individuals with high tolerances versus low tolerances to blood loss.

29262047,Pathophysiology:,The retroperitoneum is area in the back of the abdomen not covered by the peritoneum.

29262047,"In the latter process, pyruvate is produced and converted to lactic acid to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to maintain some degree of cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen.","As a result, mitochondria (cell part responsible for making chemical energy) are unable to sustain metabolisms needed for oxygen production."
29262047,"The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction.",Mitochondria switch to the less efficient metabolism to meet cell demand.
29262047,"Typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure.","Pyruvate, a chemical product of energy production, is produced and converted to maintain some cellular respiration (energy creation) in the absence of oxygen."

29262047,"Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is diverted away from noncritical organs and tissues to preserve blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain.","These alterations are followed by baroreceptor activation, which is the increased activity of receptors to regulate blood pressure."
29262047,"While prolonging heart and brain function, this also leads to other tissues being further deprived of oxygen causing more lactic acid production and worsening acidosis.",The resulting endpoints are sympathetic nervous system activation (fight-or-flight activation) and constriction of blood vessels.
29262047,"This worsening acidosis along with hypoxemia, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, worsening hemodynamic compromise, and death.","The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and pupil size."
29262047,"The body??s compensation varies by cardiopulmonary comorbidities, age, and vasoactive medications.",There is normally a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure (when the heart is relaxed) with decreased pulse pressure.
29262047,"Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely variable and, therefore, cannot be relied upon as the sole means of diagnosis.","As the rate in which the heart fills with blood declines and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure (heart is contracting) drops."

25284231,"Interestingly, even the underlying trauma mechanism (blunt or penetrating) had no influence on the number of patients who could be allocated adequately.","Because of this, more than 90% of all trauma patients could not be classified according to the ATLS(??) classification of hypovolemic shock."
25284231,"Considering these potential deficits associated with the ATLS(??) classification of hypovolaemic shock, an online survey among 383 European ATLS(??) course instructors and directors was performed to assess the actual appreciation and confidence in this tool during daily clinical trauma care.",Further review included data from the UK-based TARN registry.
25284231,"Interestingly, less than half (48%) of all respondents declared that they would assess a potential circulatory depletion within the primary survey according to the ATLS(??) classification of hypovolaemic shock.",This evaluation suggested that ATLS(??) may overestimate the degree of tachycardia (high heart rate) associated with low blood pressure and underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolemic shock.

29295637,Aims: To describe the utilization of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) and medicinal honey debridement methods in real-world inpatient and outpatient hospital settings among pressure ulcer (PU) patients and compare the frequency of healthcare re-encounters between CCO- and medicinal honey-treated patients.,We aim to describe the use of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO - a medication with special proteins) and medical honey to remove damaged tissue in hospitals among bedsore patients and compare how often CCO- and medical honey-treated patients return to the hospital.
29295637,Materials and methods: De-identified hospital discharge records for patients receiving CCO or medicinal honey methods of debridement and having an ICD-9 code for PU were extracted from the US Premier Healthcare Database.,We obtained hospital discharge records from a national database for patients getting CCO or medical honey methods of removing damaged tissues with an official diagnosis of bedsores.

28723796,No major adverse effects were found in the 2 groups.,We showed that MEBO works with no major side effects for improving would healing in Chinese patients with bedsores.
28639707,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both.","Bedsores are areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both, found in a certain part of the body."
28639707,"Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease-modulating dressings.","Doctors often use dressings to treat bedsores and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from."
28639707,Topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing.,Doctors have also used medications applied to the skin instead of dressings to promote healing.
28639707,A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers.,A clear and current summary of the scientific data is needed to help make decisions about the use of dressings or medicines applied to the skin to treat bedsores.
28639707,Such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options.,This review would ideally help people with bedsores and doctors decide the best treatment options.
28639707,This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents.,This review compares multiple studies to measure the likelihood of complete ulcer (bedsore) healing based on different dressings and medicines applied to the skin.
28639707,Main results: We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out NMA in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing.,We included 51 studies (2947 people) in this review and compared treatments based on the likelihood of complete healing.
28639707,"The network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds.","We compared 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 medicines applied to the skin and 2 mixed treatments) and looked at 39 studies in 2127 people, 783 of whom had completely healed wounds."

34692658,Pressure ulcer (PU) is a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because of its prolonged inflammatory response and impaired ECM deposition caused by local hypoxia and repeated ischemia/reperfusion.,Bedsores are a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because it causes long-lasting inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and harms the extracellular matrix (ECM; secreted by cells and surrounds cells in tissues) from not enough oxygen and blood flow.
34692658,Our previous study discovered that the non-fouling zwitterionic sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve PU healing with rapid ECM rebuilding.,The study we did before found that non-fouling zwitterionic (inner salts to which proteins and bacteria cannot stick) sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve bedsore healing and quickly rebuild ECM.

34692658,"Therefore, in this work, the impact of the SBMA hydrogel on ECM reconstruction is comprehensively studied, and the underlying mechanism is intensively investigated in a rat PU model.","In this study, we look at how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM using a rat bedsore model."
34692658,"The in vivo data demonstrate that compared to the PEG hydrogel, the SBMA hydrogel enhances the ECM remolding by the upregulation of fibronectin and laminin expression as well as the inhibition of MMP-2.","SMBA hydrogel helps remodel ECM better than PEG hydrogel, another bedsore treatment."
34692658,Further investigation reveals that the decreased MMP-2 expression of zwitterionic SBMA hydrogel treatment is due to the activation of autophagy through the inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and reduced inflammation.,The relationship between autophagy (cleaning out of damaged cells) with ECM remodeling may influence the design of wound dressings with substances that interact with biological systems for long-term wound repair.

34515659,"A low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signalled the diagnosis, which was later confirmed by identification of two recessive mutations of the ALPL gene.","These patients may be prescribed antiresorptive therapy, or drugs that block the breakdown of bone."

34515659,"Fracture healing occurred, but impaired mobility persisted.",Adult-onset HPP was identified in a 40-year-old woman.
34515659,"HPP predisposes to atypical femoral fracture (AFF) during antiresorptive therapy; hence, bisphosphonates and denosumab are contraindicated in this condition.","She had with femur fractures after 4 years of using denosumba, a drug to treat osteoporosis."
34515659,Screening patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level is recommended.,A low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signaled the diagnosis.
34515659,Learning points: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised cause of bone fragility produced by impaired matrix mineralisation that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss.,Her diagnosis of HPP was later confirmed by identification of two recessive gene mutations of the ALPL gene.
34515659,Antiresorptive therapy is contraindicated in HPP.,ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength.
34515659,Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) provides a clue to the diagnosis.,ALPL is the gene that encodes ALP.
34515659,"Elevated serum vitamin B6 (an ALP substrate) is indicative of HPP, while identification of a mutation in the ALPL gene is confirmatory.",The patient was treated with teriparatide (an osteoporosis drug) due to the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy.
34515659,Enzyme therapy with recombinant ALP (asfotase alfa) is currently prohibitively costly.,The fractures healed.
34515659,"Treatment with anabolic bone agents such as teriparatide has been reported, but whether normally mineralized bone is formed requires further study.","However, her mobility was impaired."
34547524,Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable dento-osseous disease caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) of the gene ALPL that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP).,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable, tooth and bone disease."
34547524,"TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase expressed in healthy people especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth.",HPP is caused by mutations of the gene ALPL.
34547524,"In HPP, diminished TNSALP activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), an inhibitor of mineralization, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the principal circulating form of vitamin B6 (B6).",ALPL encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP).

34547524,"However, pyridoxal (PL), the dephosphorylated form of PLP that enters cells to cofactor many enzymatic reactions, was not low but often inexplicably elevated.","TNSALP is expressed in healthy people, especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth."
34547524,"Levels of pyridoxic acid (PA), the B6 degradation product quantified to assess B6 sufficiency, were unremarkable.","In HPP, decreased TNSALP activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates, including pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)."
34547524,Canonical signs or symptoms of B6 deficiency or toxicity were absent.,PLP is the principal circulating form of vitamin B6 (B6).
34547524,B6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening HPP were later explained by their profound deficiency of TNSALP activity blocking PLP dephosphorylation to PL and diminishing gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis in the brain.,Different mutations of ALPL largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this genetic inborn-error-of-metabolism.
34547524,"Now, there is speculation that altered B6 metabolism causes further clinical complications in HPP.","In 1985, elevated (blood) plasma PLP was identified as hallmark of HPP."
34547524,"Herein, we assessed the plasma PL and PA levels accompanying previously reported elevated plasma PLP concentrations in 150 children and adolescents with HPP.","In the study, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had increased PLP levels."

34547524,"(P < 0.0001), respectively.",Signs or symptoms of B6 deficiency or toxicity were absent.
34547524,"Their PA levels were broader than our pediatric control range, but their mean value was normal; 40.2 (25.1) nM",B6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening HPP were later explained by their low TNSALP activity.

34547524,"(P = 0.7793), respectively.","This diminished formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter, in the brain."
34547524,"In contrast, adults with HPP often had plasma PL and PA levels suggestive of dietary B6 insufficiency.",It is theorized that abnormal B6 metabolism causes further health complications in HPP.
34547524,"We discuss why the B6 levels of our pediatric patients with HPP would not cause B6 toxicity or deficiency, whereas in affected adults dietary B6 insufficiency can develop.",This study assessed (measured) the blood PL and PA levels in patients with previously reported elevated plasma PLP concentrations.

8326015,Their age range was 1-16 yr.,The children ranged from 1-16 years of age.
8326015,"The first phase of insulin secretion, evaluated as the sum of plasma insulin concentrations at 1 and 3 min, increased with age and was significantly lower in ICA-negative siblings (86 +/- 6 microU/ml, P < 0.002) than in normal controls (115 +/- 6 microU/ml).","The first part of insulin release, measured as the total blood insulin levels at 1 and 3 minutes, increased with age and was significantly lower in ICA-negative siblings than in normal children."
8326015,This difference was not apparent before 8 yr of age.,We did not see a difference in the first part of insulin release before 8 years of age.
8326015,None of the ICA-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 yr.,None of the ICA-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 years.
8326015,"ICA-positive siblings at first study had a first phase insulin response similar to that of ICA negative siblings, but significantly lower than that of the normal controls (74 +/- 13 microU/ml, P < 0.02).","The first part of insulin response was similar in ICA-positive and ICA-negative siblings, but significantly lower than in normal children."
8326015,"The reason for the decreased insulin secretion in ICA-negative siblings is unknown, but could involve a defect in the growth of beta-cell mass or insulin secretion that could be part of the multifactorial pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.","We do not know the reason ICF-negative siblings had lower insulin release, but it could have to do with insulin-producing cells growing incorrectly or insulin release that could be part of the complicated development of type 1 diabetes."
8786012,We studied the effect of severe reduction of beta-cell mass by 90% pancreatectomy on the immune tolerance to the endocrine pancreas.,"We studied the effect of drastically reducing beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) mass by removing 90% of the pancreas on immune tolerance (state of unresponsiveness of the body's defense) to the endocrine pancreas, which controls blood sugar levels."
8786012,Four months after subtotal pancreatectomy all LEW.Han rats had developed mononuclear infiltration of islets and 9 of 14 rats were positive for islet-cell antibodies.,"Four months after removal of almost all of the pancreas, all rats had developed signs of long-term inflammation (infection-fighting) response of islets (clusters of cells that produce hormones) and 9 of 14 rats had islet-cell antibodies (proteins made against insulin-producing cells)."
8786012,"Electron microscopy revealed lymphocytic invasion of endocrine tissue, lysis of beta cells and phagocytotic macrophages.","Using microscopes, we saw immune white blood cells going into the part of the pancreas that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion, death of beta cells, and white blood cells that remove dying and dead cells."
8786012,None of these changes were seen 2 weeks after 90% pancreatectomy or 4 months after 10% pancreatectomy.,We saw none of these changes 2 weeks after removing 90% of the pancreas or 4 months after removing 10% of the pancreas.
8786012,Weekly substitution of islet antigens in the form of a homogenate of 100 islets into 90% pancreatectomized LEW.Han rats almost completely prevented the development of insulitis and autoantibodies.,Weekly substitution of islet antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed prevented insulitis (disease of the pancreas caused by the infiltration of immune white blood cells) and self-made proteins.
8786012,"The dependence of insulitis on T cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in LEW.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration.",Insulitis was shown to be dependent on T cells (part of the body's defense system).
8786012,The exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups.,The tissue that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion did not change in any group.
8786012,"During the observation period insulitis was not associated with overt diabetes but was accompanied by substantial enlargement of islets and of beta-cell mass, as shown by morphometry.","During the observation period, insulitis was not related to diabetes, but we saw a sizeable increase in the sizes of islets and beta-cell mass."
8786012,"Suppression of islet inflammation by injection of islet antigens abolished beta-cell regeneration, despite continuing metabolic stress in rats with 90% pancreatectomy.","Decreasing islet inflammation by injecting islet antigens (fragments) stopped beta-cell regrowth, even though low energy continued in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed."
8786012,The findings indicate induction of islet autoimmunity in response to 90% but not to 10% pancreatectomy.,The results suggest removing 90% but not 10% of the pancreas causes the body to mistakenly destroy its islets.
8786012,We conclude that severe reduction of the islet-antigen mass allows the development of T-cell-dependent islet autoimmunity which indicates a loss of immune tolerance.,"We conclude that drastically reducing the islet-antigen mass allows the body to mistakenly destroy its islets, which shows a loss of immune tolerance."
8786012,"In addition, the data suggest the existence of islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells in rats not genetically predisposed to autoimmune diabetes.","Also, the results suggest islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells exist in rats not likely to develop autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells)."
8786012,"Finally, we conclude that selective beta-cell regeneration occurs in association with insulitis.","Finally, we conclude that some beta-cell regrowth happens with insulitis."
25482141,Objective: Obese youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently have evidence of islet cell autoimmunity (proteins made against insulin-producing cells).,Obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by a doctor often have islet cell autoimmunity (in which immune cells attack healthy cells).
25482141,"We investigated the clinical and biochemical differences, and therapeutic modalities among autoantibody positive (Ab+) vs. autoantibody negative (Ab-) youth at the time of diagnosis and over time in a multi-provider clinical setting.","We looked at the observable and biochemical differences, and treatment types of self-made protein positive (Ab+) vs. self-made protein negative (Ab-) youth at diagnosis and over time at a medical facility."
25482141,Study design: Chart review of 145 obese youth diagnosed with T2DM from January 2003 to July 2012.,We reviewed medical charts of 145 obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from January 2003 to July 2012.
25482141,"Of these, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-.","Of these 145 youth, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-."
25482141,"The two groups were compared with respect to clinical presentation, physical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic modalities at diagnosis and during follow up to assess the changes in these parameters associated with disease progression.","We compared the disease symptoms, physical qualities, lab findings, and treatment types of the two groups at diagnosis and during follow up to rate the changes in these things related to disease development."
25482141,Results:,"At the doctor, Ab+ youth with a doctor's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were younger, had higher rates of not enough carbohydrates to burn, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - which indicates average blood sugar levels) and blood sugar levels, and lower insulin and signs of insulin production compared with the Ab- group."
25482141,"At presentation, Ab+ youth with a clinical diagnosis of T2DM were younger, had higher rates of ketosis, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose levels, and lower insulin and c-peptide concentrations compared with the Ab- group.",The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) score adjusted for weight and gender and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders at diagnosis and did not change over time.
25482141,The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) z-score and cardiometabolic risk factors at diagnosis and such difference remained over time.,Treatment type had no effect on BMI in either group.
25482141,Univariate analysis revealed that treatment modality had no effect on BMI in either group.,"We found that: (i) length of diabetes affected BMI score adjusted for weight and gender and diastolic blood pressure, (ii) changes In BMI score adjusted for weight and gender affected systolic blood pressure and ALT (alanine transaminase; released into the blood when liver cells are damaged), and (iii) changes in HbA1c affected lipid profile (panel of blood tests used to find abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders independent of antibody (infection-fighting protein) status."
25482141,Generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data analysis revealed that (i) BMI z-score and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly affected by duration of diabetes; (ii) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ALT were affected by changes in BMI z-score; and (iii) changes in HbA1c had an effect on lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk factors regardless of antibody status.,"Regardless of antibody status and treatment type, obese and diabetic youth do not become less obese over time, with higher BMI affecting blood pressure and ALT, and blood sugar levels affecting the lipid profile."
25482141,"Conclusions: Irrespective of antibody status and treatment modality, youth who present with obesity and diabetes, show no improvement in obesity status over time, with the deterioration in BMI z-score affecting blood pressure (BP) and ALT, but the lipid profile being mostly impacted by HbA1c and glycemic control.",Controlling BMI and blood sugar levels are needed to lessen future large blood vessel problems regardless of antibody status.
10909610,Islet cell antibodies (ICA) continue to serve as the basis of the principal serological test for definition of active autoimmunity of beta-cells.,The main blood test to determine active attack of the insulin-producing beta-cells by the body is based on islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells).
10909610,Its disadvantages are the need for human pancreatic tissue and difficulty in obtaining quantitative results.,The main ICA test has drawbacks like needing human tissue from the pancreas and difficulty in getting results in the form of a number.
10909610,"In the past decade biochemically-defined beta-cell toxins were described, leading to the development of sensitive and specific autoantibody assays, to predict insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).","Based on the description of beta-cell proteins in test tubes in the past 10 years, new measuring tools for self-made proteins were made with high accuracy for disease detection and no detection to predict type 1 diabetes."
10909610,"We examined the value of combined biochemically-based serological assays, such as autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and ICA512 (ICA512A) to replace the traditional ICA assay.","We looked at whether combined blood tests in test tubes, such as self-made proteins to insulin (IAA), the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), and ICA512 (ICA512A), could replace the main ICA test."
10909610,"Blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed IDDM patients, aged 12 +/- 5 yrs (range 2 months-29 years) were tested for ICA (indirect immunofluorescence), IAA, GADA and ICA512A (radiobinding assay).","We tested blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, aged 12 plus or minus 5 years (ranging from 2 months to 29 year) for ICA, IAA, GADA, and ICA512A."
10909610,The latter 2 assays were performed using recombinant human [35S]-labeled antigen produced by in vitro transcription/translation.,"We found that more blood samples scored positive (detected the presence of the disease) for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 than for ICA and/or IAA."
10909610,"We found that fewer sera scored positive for ICA and/or IAA (80.7%, 92/114) than for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 (88.6%, 101/114).","We conclude that testing for IAA, GAD and ICA512 together can replace the traditional ICA/IAA test to predict type 1 diabetes and is helpful to doctors in telling the different between type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
7783363,Islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) are a marker of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).,Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are an indicator of type 1 diabetes.
7783363,ICA are detected in 60-80% of the patients with IDDM at the onset of the disease.,ICA are found in 60-80% of patients with type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear.
7783363,The presence of ICA in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) indicates that the patients are likely to develop IDDM.,Type 2 diabetics with ICA are likely to develop type 1 diabetes.
7783363,"However, as ICA are measured by the indirect immunofluorescent method, the reliability of the ICA assay is not high in some institutes.",The current way to measure ICA is not always reliable.
7783363,Use of the pancreas tissue having high antigenicity is recommended as one solution for a reliable assay.,"A reliable standardized test could use pancreas tissue, tissue from an organ that monitors blood sugar levels."
7783363,Standardization of the ICA assay is under way with the use of an ICA positive standard sera as 80 JDF units.,A standardized test to measure ICA is under way.

7783363,The significance of anti-GAD antibodies is comparable to that of ICA.,Anti-GAD antibodies and ICA have similar meanings.
7783363,"Since the anti-GAD assay is reproducible and easy to perform, it should be used widely in parallel with the ICA assay.","The standardized test to measure anti-GAD can be repeated and is easy to do, so it should be used widely at the same time as the test to measure ICA."

23831240,"After adjusting for possible confounders, longer nap duration (>60 min; all P<.05) was still significantly associated with increased risk for IFG, and longer nap duration (>30 min) was associated with increased risk for DM; however, this finding was not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 min. Conclusions: Longer habitual afternoon napping was associated with a moderate increase for DM risk, independent of several covariates.","After adjusting the analysis to account for things that impact the results, longer nap duration (>60 minutes) is still significantly associated with increased risk for pre-diabetes."

21388440,"Compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise alone, continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise was associated with less post-exercise hypoglycaemia (5.2 vs. 1.5% of the time spent with glucose < 4.0 mmol/l) and more post-exercise hyperglycaemia (33.8 vs. 20.4% of time > 11.0 mmol/l).",Nighttime sugar levels are higher in continuous moderate-intensity + periodic high-intensity exercise and in inactive vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise.

10535452,"During the initial hours after start of glucose infusions, ISRs were approximately 60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects (585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05), while rates of glucose uptake were the same (5.6 mmol x kg(-1) x h(-1)), indicating that the FDRs were insulin resistant.","During the initial hours after giving people infusions of sugar (glucose), insulin secretion rates are about 60% higher in first-degree relatives than in the comparison (control) subjects, while rates of sugar uptake are the same."
10535452,"Control subjects had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in the afternoon, and declined during the night.","This finding suggests that the first-degree relatives are insulin resistant, which is when the body doesn't respond well to the insulin hormone and can't use blood sugar for energy."
10535452,"In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller amplitude that lacked true periodicity.","Control subjects have well-defined 24 hour cycles of insulin secretion rates and plasma insulin that increase in the early morning, peak in the afternoon, and decline during the night."
10535452,This suggested that the lack of a normal circadian ISR increase had made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia.,"In contrast, first-degree relatives have several shorter insulin secretion rate cycles."
10535452,"As a result, ISR decreased to the level found in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 micromol x kg(-1)",This suggests that the lack of a normal increase in the 24 hour insulin secretion rate makes it impossible for the first-degree relatives to keep their insulin excess secretion beyond 18 hours of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).
10535452,"x min(-1), P < 0.05).","As a result, insulin secretion rate decreased to the level found in control subjects, and blood sugar uptake fell below the level of control subjects."
10535452,"In summary, we found that FDRs with normal glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and secretion.","In summary, researchers found that first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar levels had defects in insulin action and secretion."
10535452,"The newly recognized insulin secretory defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian ISR cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the 24 h ISR cycle.","The new insulin secretory defect includes disrupting the normal 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and blood sugar uptake) during the upward part of the 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle."

31151228,"In the morning before breakfast, eTRF increased ketones, cholesterol, and the expression of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the autophagy gene LC3A (all p < 0.04), while in the evening, it tended to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor (BNDF; p = 0.10) and also increased the expression of MTOR (p = 0.007), a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth.","Relative to the comparison group's schedule, early time-restricted feeding decreased the average 24-hour sugar levels and changes in blood sugar."
31151228,eTRF also altered the diurnal patterns in cortisol and the expression of several circadian clock genes (p < 0.05).,"In the morning before breakfast, early time-restricted feeding increased ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), cholesterol, and the activity of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the gene LC3A that cleans out damaged cells."
31151228,"eTRF improves 24-hour glucose levels, alters lipid metabolism and circadian clock gene expression, and may also increase autophagy and have anti-aging effects in humans.","While in the evening, time-restricted feeding tends to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor, which is a helpful protein in the spinal cord and brain, and also increases the expansion of the MTOR gene, a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth."

26768579,"Within a short time frame, four additional cases were identified.  ","As more cases were found, it became clear that PHS is not such a rare disorder."
26768579,"As the full spectrum and variability of anomalies was recognized, it became clear that it was not such a rare disorder.","Shortly after, it was recognized that the disease runs in the families due to changes in the gene called GLI3."

26604140,The embryologic mechanisms controlled by GLI3R that result in these pathologic phenotypes are undefined.,"It is not known how the specific problems arise We show that variations in the GLI3 gene cause poor development of the kidneys, and a closed end in the duct that runs between the kidney and the bladder, which causes swelling of the kidneys and the duct."
26604140,"We demonstrate that germline expression of GLI3R causes renal hypoplasia, associated with decreased nephron number, and hydroureter and hydronephrosis, caused by blind-ending ureters.",Mice with the same change in the GLI3 gene also had two ducts that connected a kidney to the bladder The abnormal development is caused by the lack of information the embryonic cells (cells that forms when eggs are fertilized) need for proper development.   
26604140,Mice with obligate GLI3R expression also displayed duplication of the ureters that was caused by aberrant common nephric duct patterning and ureteric stalk outgrowth.,"Using mutant mice, we show that the development of the reproduction and urinary organs is controlled by the variants in the GLI3 gene."
26604140,These developmental abnormalities are associated with suppressed Hedgehog signaling activity in the cloaca and adjacent vesicular mesenchyme.,Different problems in PHS are caused by the different mistakes in the development of the urinary organs due to the information provided by the variants of the GLI3 gene.

15617553,The overall frequency of psychiatric findings among all patients with PHS cannot be compared to point prevalence estimates of psychiatric disease in the general population because of biased ascertainment.  ,"The tests usually evaluate reading, use of language, attention, learning, reasoning, remembering, problem-solving, and more."
15617553,This limitation is inherent to the study of behavioral phenotypes in rare disorders.  ,We did not find mental health problems specifically associated with PHS.
15617553,The general issue of psychiatric evaluation of rare genetic syndromes is discussed in light of this negative result.,The frequency of each of the problems in these patients was the same as expected in the group of 19 people.
3146300,We report on three infants with hand anomalies and congenital hypopituitarism.,"We report on three infants born with hands born with hand defects and defects of the pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth through chemical substances called hormones."
3146300,"In two of the cases, a hypothalamic tumor was found; the third infant died without postmortem brain studies.",Two of the newborns had hypothalamic tumors (noncancerous growths in the base of their brains).
3146300,"Family history in the first case suggested possible familial recurrence; the mother's sister had died at 17 hr of age with polydactyly, microglossia, and flat nasal bridge (no autopsy done).",The brain of the third newborn was not examined.
3146300,Our second case was born by cesarean section after a pregnancy complicated by extremely low maternal estriols.,"In one case, the disease runs in the family."
3146300,"At birth, hypopituitarism was diagnosed, a cranial CT scan was read as normal, and hormonal replacement was begun with thyroxine, hydrocortisone, and growth hormone.",The mother's sister died at the age of 17.
3146300,At 11.5 mo of age she developed seizures; and a repeat CT scan showed a mass extending beneath the hypothalamus.,"She had extra fingers, extremely small tongue, and flat nose."
3146300,"This tumor was removed surgically at 12 mo, the first successful treatment of this disorder.","The mother of the second newborn had very low levels of estriol, a hormone made during pregnancy that is used to measure the unborn baby's health."
3146300,"Our third possible case had a bifid epiglottis, hypopituitarism, and hand anomalies.","When this baby was born, brain imaging was normal, but the levels of hormones that regulate growth and development were low."
3146300,A CT scan at birth failed to reveal a mass in the hypothalamus.,Treatment with growth and other hormones was started.
3146300,"This child died from complications of untreated hypopituitarism, and no neuropathology studies were done.",At 11.5 months the baby started having seizures.
3146300,These three cases were conceived between March 10th and April 17th in three different years in three geographically contiguous counties of Vermont.,A new brain imaging showed a mass in the lower part of the brain.
3146300,"Clustering in time and space and possible familial recurrence, in one of these cases, suggest a possible gene/environment interaction.",Surgery to remove this mass at 12 months was the first successful treatment of this disorder.
9054938,"Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS, M146510) was first described in 1980 in six newborns.",Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) was first described in 1980 in six newborns.
9054938,"It is a pleiotropic disorder of human development that comprises hypothalamic hamartoma, central polydactyly, and other malformations.",It is caused by a single gene that is involved in development of multiple body parts.
9054938,This disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and has been mapped to 7p13 (S. Kang et al.,"The problems include a non-cancer mass in the lower part of the brain and extra fingers and toes, among others."
9054938,Autosomal dominant Pallister-Hall syndrome maps to 7p13. Am.,"This disorder is passed down by either parent, and the involved gene is located on chromosome 7, associating PHS with the gene called GLI3."
9054938,J. Hum.,"Variants of the the GLI3 gene in which some genetic information is missing or misplaced are associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) that affects development of the hands, feet, head, and face."

9054938,"59, A81 (1996)), co-localizing the PHS locus and the GLI3 zinc finger transcription factor gene.","Both PHS and GCPS are passed down from either parent, but the clinical signs of these diseases are different."
9054938,Large deletions or translocations resulting in haploinsufficiency of the GLI3 gene have been associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS; M175700) although no mutations have been identified in GCPS patients with normal karyotypes.,The additional finger in GCPS is usually located next to the thumb.
9054938,"Both PHS and GCPS have polysyndactyly, abnormal craniofacial features and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but they are clinically distinct.","In PHS, the extra finger is in the center or next to the little finger (pinky)."
9054938,The polydactyly of GCPS is commonly preaxial and that of PHS is typically central or postaxial.,The extra toes follow the same pattern: in GCPS the sixth toe is next to the big toe.
9054938,No reported cases of GCPS have hypothalamic hamartoma and PHS does not cause hypertelorism or broadening of the nasal root or forehead.,"No reported cases of GCPS have non-cancer growth in the lower part of the brain, and PHS does not cause increased distance between the eyes or broadening of the nose or forehead."
9054938,The co-localization of the loci for PHS and GCPS led us to investigate GLI3 as a candidate gene for PHS.,"Because the generic changes for PHS and GCPS share the location on the chromosome, we study GLI3 as a gene potentially responsible for PHS."
9054938,"Herein we report two PHS families with frameshift mutations in GLI3 that are 3' of the zinc finger-encoding domains, including one family with a de novo mutation.",We describe two PHS families with large changes in the GLI3 gene.
9054938,"These data implicate mutations in GLI3 as the cause of autosomal dominant PHS, and suggest that frameshift mutations of the GLI3 transcription factor gene can alter the development of multiple organ systems in vertebrates.",In one family the change is new and there is no family history of PHS.
31098348,Trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of trigeminal nerve root and it leads to demyelination gradually.,"Trigeminal nerve pain (neuralgia) is caused by pressure on the trigeminal (meaning ""threefold"", for the three branches of the nerve) nerve."
31098348,It was almost idiopathic and occurred unexpected.,The pressure leads to gradual loss of the protecting layer that covers the nerve.
31098348,The upper cervical spinal cord contains the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus.,It arises spontaneously and unexpected.
31098348,Fibers with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion enter in the upper pons and descend caudally to C2 level.,The spinal cord is the bundle of nerve tissues that connects the brain with the body.
31098348,"We experienced a rare patient with facial pain, which was paroxysmal attack with severe pain after a clear event, cervical spinal injury (C2).","In the upper neck region, it contains parts of the trigeminal nerve."
31098348,"So, this case reminds us of a possible cause of trigeminal neuralgia after a trauma of the head and neck.","The trigeminal nerve cells and fibers enter the brainstem, the bottom part of the brain connected to the spinal cord, and go down to the second vertebrae at the top of the cervical spine."
29030173,Objective: To report a novel wireless neuromodulation system for treatment of refractory craniofacial pain.,This study presents a new wireless nerve stimulation system for treatment of uncontrollable pain of the head and face.
29030173,Background: Previous studies utilizing peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the occipital and trigeminal nerves reported positive outcomes for alleviating neuropathic pain localized to the craniofacial and occipital areas.,"Previous studies reported that stimulation of the nerves called trigeminal (meaning ""threefold"", for the three branches of the nerve) and occipital (relating to the back of the head) reduces pain in the head and face."
29030173,However several technological limitations and cosmetic concerns inhibited a more widespread acceptance and use of neuromodulation.,"Due to the shortcomings of the devices and concerns about the appearance, the nerve stimulation systems are not used widely.  "
29030173,"Also, a relatively high incidence of adverse events like electrode erosions, dislocation, wire fracture and/or infection at the surgical site mandates a change in our approach to neuromodulation technology and implant techniques in the craniofacial region.","The relatively common complications are worn and broken wires, devices moving from the original placement, and infection around the device."
29030173,"Methods: We report a novel approach for the management of craniofacial pain with a wirelessly powered, minimally invasive PNS system.","To avoid these complications, we need to change the nerve stimulation systems and the way they are implanted (placed) in the head and face."
29030173,The system is percutaneously implanted and placed subcutaneously adjacent to affected facial nerves via visual guidance by the clinician.,We describe a new peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system for treatment of pain in the head and neck.
29030173,"In this feasibility study, pilot evidence was gathered in a cohort of ten subjects suffering from a combination of chronic headaches, facial pain for at least 15 days per month and for at least 4h/day.",The system is wireless and is placed using small cuts and few stitches.
29030173,Results:,"The doctors place the system under the skin, next to the damaged facial nerves This study included ten patients who experienced chronic headaches and facial pain for four or more hours a day and at least 15 days a month."
29030173,"At four weeks post-implant follow up, all patients reported sustained pain relief of the primary pain area.","Four weeks after the systems were implanted, all patients felt continuing ain relief."
29030173,Electrode location and total number of electrodes used per subject varied across the cohort.,The patients had different numbers of wires and implant locations.
29030173,The average pain reduction using the visual analog scale was ???82%.,"On average, patients felt five times less pain after treatment."
29030173,The procedure had no adverse events or side effects.,There were no complications Placing a wireless nerve stimulation device under the skin next to the damaged nerves in the head and neck reduces pain that is hard to control otherwise.
29030173,Conclusion: Percutaneous placement of a wireless neurostimulation device directly adjacent to affected craniofacial nerve(s) is a minimally invasive and reversible method of pain control in patients with craniofacial pain refractory to conventional medical managements.,This treatment is gentle and can be reversed.
7670427,Traumatic injury to the peripheral nerves often results in persistent discomfort.,"After peripheral nerves (the parts of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord) are injured, people often feel discomfort for a long time."
7670427,"Substance P has been implicated as a mediator of pain, and depletion of this neurotransmitter has been shown to reduce pain.",A chemical called Substance P is involved in the process of feeling pain.
7670427,"Subjects suffering from traumatic dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve were treated with capsaicin, a substance P depleter with significant long-term effects.",Lowering the amount of this chemical involved in the transmission of nerve signals lessens pain.
7670427,This form of therapy may be used individually or in combination with other pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia.,Capsaicin was a good long-term treatment for people who experienced an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve.
34753868,"The current understanding of ON is that it causes neuropathic pain in the distribution of the greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, the third occipital nerve or a combination of the 3.","Occipital Neuralgia is the pain in the occipital nerves, the nerves that run from the top of the spinal cord up in the back of the head."
34753868,It is currently a subset of headaches although there is some debate if ON should be its own condition.,"It is considered a type of headaches, but some doctors suggest pain in the nerves in the back of the head is a different problem."
34753868,"Occipital neuralgia causes chronic, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears that can radiate to the front of the head.","Occipital neuralgia is a continuing, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears."
34753868,"Diagnosis is typically clinical and patients present with intermittent, painful episodes associated with the occipital region and the nerves described above.",It can also extend to the front of the head.
34753868,"Most cases are unilateral pain, however bilateral pain can be present and the pain can radiate to the frontal region and face.",The doctors decide the patients have the disease if the pain in the back of the patients' heads comes and goes.
34753868,Physical examination is the first step in management of this disease and patients may demonstrate tenderness over the greater occipital and lesser occipital nerves.,"Most patients have pain on one side of their head, but the pain could also be on both sides and extend to the front of the head and face."
34753868,Anesthetics like 1% to 2% lidocaine or 0.25% to 0.5% bupivacaine can be used to block these nerves and anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids can be used in combination to prevent compressive symptoms.,"When the doctors examine the patients, the patients' skin over the nerves in the back of the head may be tender."
34753868,Other treatments like botulinum toxin and radiofrequency ablation have shown promise and require more research.,Drugs like lidocaine can block the feeling of pain in these nerves.
34753868,Surgical decompression through resection of the obliquus capitis inferior is the definitive treatment however there are significant risks associated with this procedure.,"Drugs that reduce inflammation, such as steroids may be added to keep the signs from happening."
34656508,"Post-traumatic trigeminal neuralgia (PTTN), also known as anesthesia dolorosa, is at times a debilitating affliction, but remains a condition with minimal research and without definitive treatment, specifically in the periorbital and malar regions.","Post-traumatic trigeminal neuralgia (PTTN), also known as anesthesia dolorosa, refers to the pain in the trigeminal nerve, a three-part nerve in the head that provides sensation."
34656508,Below we present a case of PTTN in a patient with historic facial trauma who has successfully achieved resolution of pain.,"PTTN is a crippling pain that has no established treatments, specifically for the pain around the eyes and back teeth."
34656508,We describe diagnostic and therapeutic anesthesia blocks and ablative procedures targeting the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves.,We describe how trigeminal nerve pain was treated in a patient who had it due to an old injury to his face.
34656508,We promote awareness for the procedures and the potential large impact on the oral and maxillofacial surgery community when treating those suffering from facial pain.,We describe surgery and treatment that blocked sensation in the facial nerves around the temples and cheek bones.
34656508,"Finally, we present an algorithm that can aid surgeons in diagnosing and treating patients with PTTN.",This treatment could be used by dental surgeons who treat patients with facial pain.
33853065,Introduction: Facial pain (FP) is a type of neuropathic pain which recognizes both central and peripheral causes.,Facial pain is nerve pain caused by nerves in the spinal cord and outside the spinal cord and brain.
33853065,It can be difficult to treat because it can often become resistant to pharmacological treatments.,It can be difficult to treat because pain relieve drugs may stop working.
33853065,"Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS) has been used in selected cases, but the correct indications of MCS in FP have not been fully established.","Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS), surgical stimulation of the nerves, is sometimes used, but it is not known yet when to use it for facial pain."
33853065,Here we systematically reviewed the literature regarding MCS in FP analysing the results of this technique and studying the possible role of different factors in the prognosis of these patients.,We review what is known about treating patients with facial pain using MCS and the outcomes of the treatment.
33853065,"Methods: A literature search was performed through different databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) according to PRISMA guidelines using the following terms in any possible combination: ""facial pain"" or ""trigeminal"" or ""anaesthesia dolorosa"" and ""motor cortex stimulation.""",We found information about 108 patients.
33853065,"Results: 111 articles were reviewed, and 12 studies were included in the present analysis for a total of 108 patients.",MCS helped almost three quarters of the patients.
33853065,"Overall, at latest follow-up (FU), 70.83% of patients responded to MCS.",The patients felt their pain was reduced almost to half of the pain they felt before surgery.
33853065,"The preoperative VAS significantly decreased at the latest FU (8.83 ?? 1.17 and 4.31 ?? 2.05, respectively; p < 0.0001).",The treatment was more effective in younger patients and those with pain on the side of the face.
33853065,Younger age (p = 0.0478) and a peripheral FP syndrome (p = 0.0006) positively affected the definitive implantation rate on univariate analysis.,Younger patients were more likely to get MCS implanted devices MCS is an effective treatment for facial pain.
33853065,Younger age emerged as a factor strongly associated to a higher probability to go to a definitive MCS implant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.0415).,Younger patients were more likely to get permanent implanted devices.
33185371,Background: Neuropathic facial pain occurs due to pathologic dysfunctions of a nerve responsible for mediating sensory fibers to the head.,Neural facial pain is caused by the nerves that transmit sensation to the head.
33185371,"Surgical interventions, in cases of failed medical therapy, include microvascular decompression, radiofrequency (RF) ablation, percutaneous balloon decompression, and stereotactic radiosurgery.","If medicines do not help, surgery may be used."
33185371,"In this review, we focused on RF ablation as a treatment for chronic facial pain.",Surgeries relieve compressed nerves (microvascular decompression); or shrink tissues using radio waves (radiofrequency (RF) ablation) or local radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery).
33185371,"Objectives: The objective of this review was to summarize available evidence behind RF ablation for facial pain, including pain outcome measures, secondary outcomes, and complications.",Other surgeries prevent the nerve from transmitting signals (percutaneous balloon decompression.)
33185371,Study design: Systematic review.,We discuss using radio waves (RF ablation) to treat chronic facial pain.
33185371,Setting: This systematic review examined studies that applied the use of RF ablation for management of facial pain.,"We summarize what is known about RF ablation for facial pain, including treatment results and complications.   "
33185371,Methods: This systematic review was reported following the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).,"We summarize the pain relief results, patient satisfaction, quality of life, decrease in the drug use, and how often the pain returns."
33185371,Two reviewers independently scored the methodological quality of the selected studies.,Combining two different types of radio wave treatments (continuous radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF))reduced pain the best.
33185371,"Due to heterogeneity of studies, a best-evidence synthesis of the available prognostic factors was provided.","CRF treatment was second best, followed by PRF."
33185371,Results:,"All treatments improved patient satisfaction and quality of life, and decreased drug use and return of the pain."
33185371,"We reviewed 44 studies and assessed their short- and long-term pain relief measurements, as well as secondary outcomes including patient satisfaction, quality of life improvements, decrease in oral medication use, and recurrence rates.","Common complications of the treatment included facial numbness, weakness of facial muscles, bruised cheeks, failure to blink when the eye is touched, and dry eyes.  "
33185371,"Maximal pain relief was achieved in treatment groups using combined continuous radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapies, followed by CRF therapy alone and finally PRF therapy alone.",We conclude that radio wave treatment (RF ablation) is efficient in treating patients with facial pain.
33185371,All treatment regimens improved secondary outcomes.,It also improves quality of life and reduces drug use.
33185371,"Common complications of treatment included facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas, diminished corneal reflex, and dry eyes.",Maximal pain control is achieved using combined CRF and PRF therapy.
33185371,"Limitations: A large variability in definitions of trigeminal neuralgia, RF technique, and patient selection bias was observed in our selected cohort of studies.","Complications of the treatment were not frequent and included facial numbness, weakness of facial muscles, bruised cheeks, failure to blink when the eye is touched, and dry eyes."
32918059,Introduction: The complex nature of facial pain conditions creates a diagnostic challenge which may necessitate specialist referral.,Facial pain may be hard to recognize and a specialist might need to examine the patient.
32918059,Aim: To identify the case mix presenting to a specialist tertiary care facial pain clinic.  ,The study's aim was to identify the mix of patient cases at a specialist facial pain clinic.
32918059,Methods: A retrospective review of 112 patient records was undertaken.,We reviewed the records of 112 patients who visited the specialists at the facial pain clinic.
32918059,Trends in provisional diagnoses from referrers and the correlation to diagnoses made following specialist consultation were reviewed.,We compared the reasons for specialist consultation given by the primary doctors to the diagnoses made by the specialists.
32918059,"Results: The most common provisional diagnoses recorded in referral letters were painful temporomandibular disorders, trigeminal neuralgia and persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP).",Most often the primary doctors thought the patients' pain was caused by problems with the temporomandibular joints that connect the lower jaw to the skull; pain in the trigeminal nerve that sends signals about sensations in the face to the brain; and other facial pain.
32918059,Over a quarter of referrals did not include a provisional diagnosis.,Over a quarter of patients referred to the cliniic had no diagnosis.
32918059,"Following assessment, only one case was not given a definitive diagnosis and no patients were diagnosed with PIFP.",The specialist could not diagnose only one patient and have not diagnosed any patients with unspecified facial pain.
32918059,"A causative factor was identified in all the initially queried PIFP cases, and painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain was found in multiple patients.",The specialists found causes of all previously unspecified facial pain.
32918059,Conclusions: Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain onset coincides with dental treatment or other traumatic events.,Many patients had trigeminal nerve pain following an injury (Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain ).
32918059,PIFP is a rare facial pain diagnosis and may be over-diagnosed by dental and medical practitioners.,Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain started after dental treatment or injury.
32918059,It is important to systematically exclude other causes before reaching this diagnosis.,Unspecified facial pain is rare and may be overused by dentists and physicians.
32918059,"This will facilitate effective treatment, manage patient expectations and potentially reduce unnecessary referrals.",All other causes should be excluded before diagnosis of the unspecified facial pain.
32791919,Introduction:,Neuralgia is pain in the nerves that feels as bursts of electric-shock-like pain.
32791919,Trigeminal neuralgia is an exemplary neuropathic pain condition characterized by paroxysmal electric-shock-like pain.,Up tp half of the patients also experience continuous pain.
32791919,"However, up to 50% of patients also experiences concomitant continuous pain.","We study the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root (a part of the nerve that helps the face recognize pain, touch, heat and cold sensations, as well as chewing."
32791919,"In this neuroimaging study, we aimed to identify the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root in patients with concomitant continuous pain.",We studied patients with continuous pain.
32791919,Methods: We enrolled 73 patients with a definitive diagnosis of classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and 40 healthy participants.,We studied 73 patients with trigeminal neuralgia (nerve pain) and 40 healthy participants.
32791919,The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians.,The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians.
32791919,Patients were grouped as patients with purely paroxysmal pain (45 patients) and patients also with concomitant continuous pain (28 patients).,45 patients had only Burts of pain and 28 patients had continuous pain along with the bursts.
32791919,"All participants underwent a structured clinical examination and a 3T MRI with sequences dedicated to the anatomical study of the trigeminal nerve root, including volumetric study.",All patients had clinical examination and MRI.
32791919,"Images analysis was independently performed by two investigators, blinded to any clinical data.",Two specialists studied the images without losing at the clinical data.
32791919,Results:,"In most patients with continuous pain it started as burning, throbbing or aching sensation."
32791919,"In most patients with concomitant continuous pain, this type of pain, described as burning, throbbing or aching, manifested at the disease onset.","The patients in the two groups and the frequency and location of the nerve damage signs in these patients were similar On the contrary, patients with both the bursts and continuous pain had more atrophy ((decrease in size) of the trigeminal nerve than the patients with bursts only."
32791919,Demographic and clinical variables did not differ between the two groups of patients; the frequency of neurovascular compression and nerve dislocation were similar.,Clinical examination of patients with trigeminal nerve pain and their medical images show that patients who experienced continuous pain along with pain bursts lost some nerve tissues.
32791919,"Conversely, trigeminal nerve root atrophy was more severe in patients with concomitant continuous pain than in those with purely paroxysmal pain (p = 0.006).",This type of pain is related to wrong signaling in the nerve that lost tissues.
31688325,Orofacial pain syndromes encompass several clinically defined and classified entities.,Orofacial pain syndromes are diseases known to cause pain in the face and mouth.
31688325,"The focus here is on the role of clinical neurophysiologic and psychophysical tests in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and pathophysiological mechanisms of definite trigeminal neuropathic pain and other chronic orofacial pain conditions (excluding headache and temporomandibular disorders).","We discuss clinical examinations of the neural system that help identifying trigeminal nerve pain and other chronic facial pain conditions, but not headaches and problems with TMJ."
31688325,The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading Painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains.,The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading Painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains.
31688325,"In addition to unambiguous painful posttraumatic or postherpetic trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, and trigeminal neuralgia have also been identified with neurophysiologic and quantitative sensory testing to involve the nervous system.","Clinical examinations of the nervous system help identifying painful conditions of the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain."
31688325,"Despite normal clinical examination, these all include clusters of patients with evidence for either peripheral or central nervous system pathology compatible with the subclinical end of a continuum of trigeminal neuropathic pain conditions.",These conditions may start after an injury (posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy) or herpes infection (postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy).
31688325,"Useful tests in the diagnostic process include electroneuromyography with specific needle, neurography techniques for the inferior alveolar and infraorbital nerves, brain stem reflex recordings (blink reflex with stimulation of the supraorbital, infraorbital, mental, and lingual nerves; jaw jerk; masseter silent period), evoked potential recordings, and quantitative sensory testing.","Other related conditions are burning mouth syndrome (a burning, scalding, or tingling feeling in the mouth) and persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, which is described as continuing pain in the face and teeth of unknown cause."
31688325,"Habituation of the blink reflex and evoked potential responses to repeated stimuli evaluate top-down inhibition, and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation allows the mapping of reorganization within the motor cortex in chronic neuropathic pain.",Even patients who appear normal on clinical examination have damage to their nervous system that can cause trigeminal nerve pain.
31688325,"With systematic use of neurophysiologic and quantitative sensory testing, many of the current ambiguities in the diagnosis, classification, and understanding of chronic orofacial syndromes can be clarified for clinical practice and future research.","Diagnostic tests include recording electrical signals in the muscles (electroneuromyography), MRI of the nerves around the eyes, blink reflexes and jaw jerk when different nerves are stimulated, recording electrical signals after the nerves are stimulated, and tests for pain sensation."
35081293,Background:,The three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) work well and fewer vaccinated people get sick.
35081293,"Although the three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) that have received emergency use authorization in the United States are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring.","Breakthrough infections still sometimes happen, which means vaccinated people may get sick."
35081293,Data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients.,We need data on the use of the same booster and boosters that are different from the primary vaccine in fully vaccinated people.
35081293,"Methods: In this phase 1-2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 ??g, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson-Janssen) at a dose of 5??1010 virus particles, or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at a dose of 30 ??g.","In this clinical trial, fully vaccinated adults with no reported history of COVID-19 infection got a booster injection at least 12 weeks after the primary vaccination."
35081293,"The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29.","They got one of the three vaccines: Moderna, Johnson & Johnson-Janssen, or Pfizer."
35081293,"Results: Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine.","On trial days 15 and 29 they were checked for booster safety, signs of the body??s response to the vaccine, and ability to build up protection against the COVID-19 virus."
35081293,Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series.,458 people participated in the trial.
35081293,"More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia.","154 got Moderna, 150 got Johnson & Johnson, and 153 got Pfizer."
35081293,"For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614 G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55.",Signs of the body??s response to the booster were similar to the primary vaccine.
35081293,"Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73.","More than half had injection-site pain, general discomfort, headache, or muscle aches."
35081293,Spike-specific T-cell responses increased in all but the homologous Ad26.COV2.S-boosted subgroup.,All boosters increased the body's ability to protect itself against the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 4-fold to over 70-fold.
35081293,"CD8+ T-cell levels were more durable in the Ad26.COV2.S-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in the mRNA vaccine recipients.",The numbers of the antibodies that protect against COVID-19 increased from 5-fold to over 50-fold.
35081293,Conclusions: Homologous and heterologous booster vaccines had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in adults who had completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.,"Using the same vaccine for the boosters increased the protection up to 20-fold, but using a different vaccine increased the protection more."
35057798,"Background: The humoral immune response after primary immunisation with a SARS-CoV-2 vector vaccine (AstraZeneca AZD1222, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Vaxzevria) followed by an mRNA vaccine boost (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2; Moderna, m-1273) was examined and compared with the antibody response after homologous vaccination schemes (AZD1222/AZD1222 or BNT162b2/BNT162b2).",We studied how the immune system responds to Pfizer or Moderna booster after AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination.
35057798,"Methods: Sera from 59 vaccinees were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and virus-neutralising antibodies (VNA) with three IgG assays based on (parts of) the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein as antigen, an IgG immunoblot (additionally contains the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) as an antigen), a surrogate neutralisation test (sVNT), and a Vero-cell-based virus-neutralisation test (cVNT) with the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC; alpha) as antigen.",We compared these cross-vaccine boosters to using the same boosters as the original vaccine: AstraZeneca or Pfizer.
35057798,"Investigation was done before and after heterologous (n = 30 and 42) or homologous booster vaccination (AZD1222/AZD1222, n = 8/9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n = 8/8).",We tested the blood of 59 vaccinated people for its ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the chemicals the body produced to fight the virus.
35057798,"After the second immunisation, a subgroup of 26 age- and gender-matched sera (AZD1222/mRNA, n = 9; AZD1222/AZD1222, n = 9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n = 8) was also tested for VNA against VOC B.1.617.2 (delta) in the cVNT.",The blood was tested before and after the booster vaccine was given.  
35057798,The strength of IgG binding to separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by avidity.,"After the first vaccine, chemicals against the parts of the virus that damage human cells ranged from 55-95% for AstraZeneca to 100% for Pfizer."
35057798,Results:,"After the boosters, the blood developed highly effective chemicals that block the parts of the virus that damage human cells.   "
35057798,"After the first vaccination, the prevalence of IgG directed against the (trimeric) SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) varied from 55-95% (AZD1222) to 100% (BNT162b2), depending on the vaccine regimen and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used.",Vaccination with different boosters caused the blood to produce more anti-COVID-19 chemicals that boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine.
35057798,"The booster vaccination resulted in 100% seroconversion and the occurrence of highly avid IgG, which is directed against the S-protein subunit 1 and the RBD, as well as VNA against VOC B.1.1.7, while anti-NP IgGs were not detected.",Boosting with different vaccines strongly protects against COVID-19 at about the same level as boosting with the same original Pfizer vaccine.
35057798,The results of the three anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests showed an excellent correlation to the VNA titres against this VOC.,All vaccines caused the blood to develop strong protection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose.
35057798,The agreement of cVNT and sVNT results was good.,The protection against the delta variant of COVID-19 was not as strong in the 26 people in whom it was measured.
34918097,"Rationale for review: Heterologous prime-boost doses of COVID-19 vaccines ('mix-and-match' approach) are being studied to test for the effectiveness of Oxford (AZD1222), Pfizer (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccines for COVID in 'Com-Cov2 trial' in UK, and that of Oxford and Pfizer vaccines in 'CombivacS trial' in Spain.","??Mix-and-match?? boosters against COVID-19 are being studied in UK and Spain using Oxford, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines."
34918097,"Later, other heterologous combinatios of CoronaVac (DB15806), Janssen (JNJ-78436735), CanSino (AD5-nCOV), and other were also being trialed to explore their effectiveness.","Other combinations of CoronaVac, Janssen, and CanSino are also being tested."
34918097,"Previously, such a strategy was deployed for HIV, Ebola virus, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and hepatitis B to develop the artificial acquired active immunity.",The ??mix-and-match?? strategy has been used before to develop body protection against other diseases.
34918097,The present review explores the science behind such an approach for candidate COVID-19 vaccines developed using eleven different platforms approved by the World Health Organization.,We will try to understand why this approach might work for COVID-19.
34918097,"Key findings: The candidate vaccines' pharmaceutical parameters (e.g. platforms, number needed to vaccinate and intervals, adjuvanted status, excipients and preservatives added, efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine adverse events, and boosters), and clinical aspects must be analysed for the mix-and-match approach.","To study the mix-and-match approach, we look at how the different vaccines work, the chemicals in the vaccines and their side effects."
34918097,"Heterologous prime-boost trials showed safety, effectiveness, higher systemic reactogenicity, well tolerability with improved immunogenicity, and flexibility profiles for future vaccinations, especially during acute and global shortages, compared to the homologous counterparts.","The mix-and-match strategy is safe, improves body protection and allows to deal with vaccine shortages."
34883053,"Background: Given the importance of flexible use of different COVID-19 vaccines within the same schedule to facilitate rapid deployment, we studied mixed priming schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAd], AstraZeneca), two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2",It is important to have flexibility in using different COVID-19 vaccines for additional doses.
34883053,"[BNT], Pfizer-BioNTech, and mRNA-1273","We studied mixing AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, which work differently."
34883053,"[m1273], Moderna) and a nanoparticle vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant (NVX-CoV2373 [NVX], Novavax).","In this clinical trial, adults aged 50 years and older who received the first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine got a second dose of the same vaccine or Moderna or Novavax 8-12 weeks after the first dose."
34883053,"Methods: Com-COV2 is a single-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial in which adults aged 50 years and older, previously immunised with a single dose of ChAd or BNT in the community, were randomly assigned (in random blocks of three and six) within these cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a second dose intramuscularly (8-12 weeks after the first dose) with the homologous vaccine, m1273, or NVX.","28 days after the second dose, chemicals the body produces to protect itself against COVID-19 were measured in the blood."
34883053,"The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0??63 for the one-sided 98??75% CI.",These people did not have these chemicals before the study.
34883053,"The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline.",We also studied safety of the vaccines.  
34883053,Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine.,1072 people participated in the study 9.4 weeks after getting the first vaccine.
34883053,"The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311.",540 people got the first dose of AstraZeneca and 532 got Pfizer.
34883053,"Findings: Between April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9??4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female).",There were somewhat more men than women in both groups.
34883053,"In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd/m1273 (20 114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]/mL [95% CI 18 160 to 22 279]) and ChAd/NVX (5597 ELU/mL","28 days after the boosters, all people who had the first AstraZeneca vaccine had an increased number of chemicals against COVID-19 in their blood for all boosters."
34883053,[4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of ChAd/ChAd recipients (1971 ELU/mL,"In people who had the Pfizer vaccine first, getting a Pfizer or Moderna booster increased the chemicals the most."
34883053,"[1718 to 2262]) with a GMR of 10??2 (one-sided 98??75% CI 8??4 to ???) for ChAd/m1273 and 2??8 (2??2 to ???) for ChAd/NVX, compared with ChAd/ChAd.","Novavax also increased the amount of anti-COVID-19 chemicals, but not as much as the other boosters."
34883053,"In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT/m1273 (GMC 22 978 ELU/mL","15 people had serious problems, but the problems were not caused by the vaccine."
34883053,[95% CI 20 597 to 25 636]) but not for BNT/NVX (8874 ELU/mL,Getting a Moderna dose after AstraZeneca or Pfizer first vaccines temporarily increased protection against COVID-19 more than getting the same second vaccine.
34883053,"[7391 to 10 654]), compared with BNT/BNT (16 929 ELU/mL",Novavax did not work the same way.
34883053,"[15 025 to 19 075]) with a GMR of 1??3 (one-sided 98??75% CI 1??1 to ???) for BNT/m1273 and 0??5 (0??4 to ???) for BNT/NVX, compared with BNT/BNT; however, NVX still induced an 18-fold rise in GMC 28 days after vaccination.",Many vaccines can be used as the second dose after getting the first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer.
34883053,"There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation.",This should help distributing vaccines around the world.
34671773,"Background: While Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring.","Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines protect against Covid-19 well, but some vaccinated people may get sick, which is called breakthrough infections."
34671773,Booster vaccinations have recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for certain populations but are restricted to homologous mRNA vaccines.,Boosters with the same Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are approved as an emergency measure for some people.
34671773,We evaluated homologous and heterologous booster vaccination in persons who had received an EUA Covid-19 vaccine regimen.,We evaluated boosters with the same and different vaccines in people who got the emergency Covid-19 vaccination.
34671773,"Methods: In this phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial conducted at ten U.S. sites, adults who received one of three EUA Covid-19 vaccines at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had no reported history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 100-??g, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S 5??10 10 virus particles, or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 30-??g; nine combinations).","In this clinical trial, adults in ten U.S. locations got Moderna, Janssen or Pfizer boosters at least 12 weeks after getting the first vaccine."
34671773,"The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on study days 15 and 29.",We evaluated the vaccine safety and protection against COVID-19 on study days 15 and 29.
34671773,"Results: 458 individuals were enrolled: 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.CoV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 booster vaccines.","Out of 458 people, 154 got Moderna, 150 got Janssen and 153 got Pfizer boosters."
34671773,Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series.,Adverse reactions to the booster were similar to those reported for the first vaccine.
34671773,"Injection site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia occurred in more than half the participants.","More than half of the participants had pain at the injection site, overall weakness, headache, and muscle pains."
34671773,Booster vaccines increased the neutralizing activity against a D614G pseudovirus (4.2-76-fold) and binding antibody titers (4.6-56-fold) for all combinations; homologous boost increased neutralizing antibody titers 4.2-20-fold whereas heterologous boost increased titers 6.2-76-fold.,Boosters with the same and different vaccines increased protection against the virus.
34671773,"Day 15 neutralizing and binding antibody titers varied by 28.7-fold and 20.9-fold, respectively, across the nine prime-boost combinations.",The increase in protection after a different booster was higher.
34671773,Conclusion: Homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations were well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults who completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.,Boosters with the same and different vaccines were well-tolerated and increased protection against COVID-19 in adults who had the first vaccine at least 12 weeks earlier.
34370971,Background: Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation.,Boosters that are not of the same type as the first COVID-19 vaccine can make global COVID-19 immunization easier.
34370971,"However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules.","However, we know that getting AstraZeneca and Pfizer 4 weeks apart causes more side effects than getting the same vaccine."
34370971,"Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines.",We report the safety and protective strength of different ways to combine AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.
34370971,"Methods: Com-COV is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity.",Healthy adults aged 50 years and older that did not have COVID-19 participated in a clinical trial.
34370971,Adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the UK.,Most participants got two doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer or a combination of Pfizer/AstraZeneca or AstraZeneca/Pfizer 28 or 84 days apart.
34370971,"The majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT, or BNT/ChAd, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals.",100 of the participants that had the vaccines 28 days apart was checked for the protective chemicals in the blood more often.
34370971,"A small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only).",Participants did not know which vaccines they got.  
34370971,Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval.,"28 days after boost, chemicals that fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus were measured in patients' blood."
34370971,"The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration (measured by ELISA) at 28 days after boost, when comparing ChAd/BNT with ChAd/ChAd, and BNT/ChAd with BNT/BNT.",Different-vaccine boosters were considered to be as good as the same-vaccine if the increase in the protective chemicals after the booster was the same or higher for the different vaccines.
34370971,The heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 97??5% CI of the GMR of these comparisons was greater than 0??63.,Protection against COVID-19 was measured in all participants.
34370971,"The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline.",Safety of the vaccine was measured among participants that had at least one dose of the vaccine.  
34370971,Safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine.,"For 463 participants with 28 days between the first vaccine and the booster, the results are reported here."
34370971,"The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 69254139.",The participants were 54 to 65 years old.
34370971,"Findings: Between Feb 11 and Feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here.",About half (212) were women and a quarter (117) were from ethnic minorities.
34370971,"The mean age of participants was 57??8 years (SD 4??7), with 212 (46%) female participants and 117 (25%) from ethnic minorities.","28 days after the booster, in people who got boosted with Pfizer after AstraZeneca, protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not worse than in those who got the same AstraZeneca booster."
34370971,"At day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12 906 ELU/mL) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1392 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 9??2 (one-sided 97??5% CI 7??5 to ???).",Boosting with AstraZeneca after Pfizer was not as good as getting the second dose of the same Pfizer vaccine.
34370971,"In participants primed with BNT, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, 7133 ELU/mL) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, 14 080 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 0??51 (one-sided 97??5% CI 0??43 to ???).",Four people had serious health problems during the trial.
34370971,"Four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation.",The problems were not related to getting the vaccines.
34370971,Interpretation:,"Although getting AstraZeneca after Pfizer was not as good as getting only Pfizer or Pfizer after AstraZeneca, there were still more protective chemicals against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood compared to getting only AstraZeneca."
34370971,"Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation.",Getting only AstraZeneca is known to protect against COVID-19 and hospitalization.
34370971,"Along with the higher immunogenicity of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAD/ChAd, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.",This trial supports using boosters that are not the same as the first COVID-19 vaccine.
35147657,Reports of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals1 have prompted the recommendation for vaccine boosters to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.,"Boosters to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in those who had the first vaccines are needed because the amount of body substances that protect against the virus goes down and people get COVID-19, which is called breakthrough infections."
35147657,"Despite more than 80% of the population in Singapore having received 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, cases surged in September 2021 with the relaxation of social distancing and quarantine measures.","Although 80 out of 100 people in Singapore had 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 surged in September 2021 as the social distancing and quarantine rules were relaxed."
35147657,"In response, adults 60 years and older who completed their primary vaccination series at least 6 months prior were invited to receive a booster injection and given a choice of either 30-??g BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 50-??g mRNA-1273 (Moderna).",Adults 60 years and older who got the first vaccine at least 6 months before were invited to get a booster of Pfizer or Moderna.
35147657,We estimated SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease severity with the receipt of a booster and by type of booster.,We estimated SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease severity after getting a booster and by type of booster.
35147657,Methods: This study was carried out under the Infectious Diseases Act for policy decision-making and exempted from ethical review and informed consent by the Singapore Ministry of Health.,"Rates and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections between September 15 and October 31, 2021, among those eligible to receive vaccine boosters were studied."
35147657,"Rates and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections between September 15 and October 31, 2021, among those eligible to receive vaccine boosters between September 15 and October 15, 2021, were analyzed based on official data reported to the Singapore Ministry of Health.",COVID-19 patients were found through testing of those with symptoms and high-risk workers and close contacts without symptoms.
35147657,Cases were identified through testing of symptomatic individuals and nonsymptomatic high-risk workers and close contacts.,"We measured infections confirmed by tests and severe disease (requiring oxygen support, intensive care admission, or death due to COVID-19)."
35147657,"Outcomes included polymerase chain reaction??confirmed infections and severe disease (requiring oxygen supplementation, intensive care admission, or death due to COVID-19).","People who got the boosters 12 days before were included in the booster group, and non-booster group otherwise."
35147657,Individuals were classified under the booster group 12 days after receiving a vaccine booster and under the nonbooster group otherwise to account for time required for antibody levels to rise.,"Depending on the day of observation, a person could be in either group."
35147657,Person-days at risk were reported because individuals could contribute observations to both the nonbooster and booster groups.,We estimated getting infected and severe disease between booster and non-booster groups that got the first vaccination with Pfizer or Moderna.
35147657,"Using a Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of confirmed infections and severe disease between booster and nonbooster groups by type of vaccine received for the primary series (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273).","We accounted for the patients' sex, race, housing type, age, and the date of second vaccine that may be related to the strength of protection."
35147657,"Covariates included sex, race (4 official racial categories reported in Singapore are Chinese, Malay, Indian, and others and registered at birth according to the child??s parents?? race), housing type as a marker of socioeconomic status, age group, date of second vaccine dose to account for possible waning of immunity, and individual dummy variables for calendar date to adjust for the varying force of infection over the study period (eMethods in the Supplement).",We observed the rate of infection in those who got the same booster as the first vaccine and a different vaccine as booster.  
35147657,We obtained IRRs for individuals receiving the same vaccine as a booster (homologous boosted) and those receiving a different vaccine (heterologous boosted).,"Out of 703,209 people who were allowed to have a booster during the study, 576,132 got boosters."
35147657,Data analysis was carried out in Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC) and a 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.,"More than half of the people were 60 to 69 years old, a third 70 to 79 years, and a tenth of the people were 0 years and older."
35147657,Results:,Slightly more than half of the people were women.
35147657,"Among 703??209 eligible individuals during the study period, 576??132 received boosters.","Among those for whom the first vaccine and the booster was Pfizer, about 230 people got COVID-19 and about 2 had severe disease."
35147657,"The study included 22??643??521 and 9??339??981 person-days among the nonbooster and booster groups, respectively.","Among those who had the first Pfizer vaccine but no booster, 600 got COVID-19 and 20 had severe disease."
35147657,"By person-days, 59% were 60 to 69 years, 29% were 70 to 79 years, and 11% were aged 80 years and older, with 53% being female.","Among those who had a different booster, about 150 people got COVID-19 and about 2 had severe disease."
35147657,"Among individuals who received BNT162b2 for their primary series, the incidences (per million person-days) of confirmed and severe infections were 227.9 and 1.4 for the homologous boosted compared with 600.4 and 20.5 for the nonboosted.","Among those who had Moderna as their first vaccine and booster, about 134 got COVID-19."
35147657,"The IRRs were 0.272 (95% CI, 0.258-0.286) for the confirmed cases among the homologous-boosted individuals and 0.047 (95% CI, 0.026-0.084) for severe cases (Table).","Among those who first had Moderna and then a Pfizer booster, about 100 had COVID-19."

35147657,The number of severe infections among individuals receiving mRNA-1273 for their primary series was too small to assess IRRs.,Boosting with different vaccines may provide greater protection against COVID-19.
35126395,Background: Heterologous vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and a second dose of an mRNA-based vaccine have been shown to be more immunogenic than homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.,Getting a Pfizer or Moderna booster after the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against COVID-19 better than getting the same AstraZeneca booster.
35126395,"In the current study, we examined the kinetics of the antibody response to the second dose of three different vaccination regimens (homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 + BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) against SARS-CoV-2 in a longitudinal manner; whether there are differences in latency or amplitude of the early response and which markers are most suitable to detect these responses.",We studied how a booster with the same AstraZeneca or a different Pfizer or Moderna vaccine protects against COVID-19 over time.
35126395,"Methods: We performed assays for anti-S1 IgG and IgA, anti-NCP IgG and a surrogate neutralization assay on serum samples collected from 57 participants on the day of the second vaccination as well as the following seven days.",We analyzed chemicals that protect against COVID-19 in the blood of 57 people on the day of the second vaccination and the following seven days.
35126395,Results: All examined vaccination regimens induced detectable antibody responses within the examined time frame.,All boosters increased the protective chemicals in the blood.
35126395,Both heterologous regimens induced responses earlier and with a higher amplitude than homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.,Different boosters had earlier and stronger protection than boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine.
35126395,"Between the heterologous regimens, amplitudes were somewhat higher for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 + mRNA-1273.",People who had Moderna booster after the first AstraZeneca vaccine had more protective chemicals than those who got Pfizer.
35126395,There was no difference in latency between the IgG and IgA responses.,The body produced different protective chemicals at the same time.  
35126395,Increases in the surrogate neutralization assay were the first changes to be detectable for all regimens and the only significant change seen for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.,The different boosters were more protective than the same AstraZeneca booster.  
35099023,Introduction: The vital renal replacement therapy makes it impossible for dialysis patients to distance themselves socially.,Dialysis patients cannot distance themselves socially.
35099023,This results in a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing COVID-19 with excess mortality due to disease burden and immunosuppression.,They are at high risk of developing COVID-19 with high mortality.
35099023,"We determined the efficacy of a 100 ??g booster of mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) 6 months after two doses of BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, NY, USA) in 194 SARS-CoV-2 na??ve dialysis patients.",We studied Moderna boosters 6 months after two doses of Pfizer in 194 dialysis patients who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection.
35099023,"Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies were measured with the Elecsys?? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 as well as 4 weeks after the mRNA-1273 booster.","We measured the chemicals that protect against the COVID-19 virus 4 weeks after Pfizer and Moderna boosters, and also 10-12 weeks after Pfizer  Protective chemicals were found in about 9 out of 10 people 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of Pfizer."
35099023,"The presence of neutralizing antibodies was measured by the SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (GenScript Biotech, USA).","Looking at different protective thresholds, protection was reduced to 7 out of 10 after 4 weeks and around half after 10-12 weeks."
35099023,"Two different cut-offs for positivity were used, one according to the manufacturer's specifications and one correlating with positivity in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).","For Moderna, almost all people had strong protection after 4 weeks."
35099023,ROC analyses were performed to match the anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibody cut-offs with the cut-offs in the surrogate neutralization assay accordingly.,People on dialysis who were vaccinated with Pfizer and got Moderna booster within the next 6 month had significant protection against the COVID-19 virus.
35099023,Results: Any level of immunoreactivity determined by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibody assay was found in 87.3% (n = 144/165) and 90.6% (n = 164/181) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2.,"While the first two doses of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine gave adequate protection to some patients, the booster increased protection against the COVID-19 virus in almost all patients."
35131144,"In Spain, 1.5 million essential < 60-year-old workers were vaccinated with a first AstraZeneca vaccine dose.","In Spain, 1.5 million essential workers under 60 years of age got a first AstraZeneca vaccine dose."
35131144,"After assessing the cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia associated to this vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) supported the administration of 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with no age restrictions.","Although this vaccine was associated with blood clots and reduction in blood cells, the European Medicines Agency recommended two doses of AstraZeneca for all ages."
35131144,"Nevertheless, Spain decided not to administer the second dose of this vaccine to < 60-year-olds.",Spain decided not to give the second dose of this vaccine to people under 60 years old.
35131144,The government sponsored a clinical trial (CombiVacS) to assess the immunogenicity response to a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose in adults primed with the AstraZeneca vaccine.,The government sponsored a clinical trial to evaluate if a dose of Pfizer vaccine works in adults who first got the AstraZeneca vaccine.
35131144,The positive results backed the Public Health Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Health to offer the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as the booster.,The positive results supported giving the Pfizer vaccine as the booster.
35131144,"Nevertheless, regional public health authorities-responsible for administering vaccines-believed that, following the EMA's decision, an AstraZeneca booster dose should be given.",Some local authorities decided to follow the recommendation that an AstraZeneca booster should be given.
35131144,The public confrontation of these 2 positions forced the Spanish Health Ministry to request the signature of an informed consent form to those individuals willing to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine booster and rejecting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose.,"Because of these contradictions, the Spanish Health Ministry requested those who decide to get the AstraZeneca booster and decline Pfizer should sign an informed consent form."
35131144,"Eventually, it was decided that these essential workers could choose the vaccine but signing an informed consent form.",Later these essential workers could choose the vaccine but still sign an informed consent form.
35131144,All relevant information was posted on the Ministry of Health and regional health authorities' websites and provided to potential vaccine recipients at vaccination sites.,Relevant information was posted on the web and given to people at vaccination sites.
35131144,Most individuals (??? 75%) chose the AstraZeneca vaccine: perhaps because they likely trusted the EMA more than the CombiVacS results.,Three quarters of people getting the vaccine chose AstraZeneca; maybe because they trusted the European Medicines Agency more.  
35131144,"This unprecedented and massive exercise of individual autonomy about the choice of COVID-19 vaccines from 2 different platforms has shown that adequately informed persons can autonomously weigh their options, regardless of government decisions.",Giving people a choice may make future COVID-19 boosters more successful.
32766111,We experienced a 72-year-old man who developed laboratory-confirmed human coronavirus HKU1 pneumonia.,A 72-year-old man has a confirmed human coronavirus HKU1 pneumonia.
32766111,"PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative twice, and rapid immunochromatographic antibody test (RIAT) using a commercially available kit for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 showed him turning positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2.","His nasal swab test for COVID-19 virus was negative twice, but his antibody (chemicals the body produces to fight the virus) test was positive."
32766111,"We then performed RIAT in stored serum samples from other patients who suffered laboratory-confirmed human common cold coronaviruses (n = 6) and viruses other than coronavirus (influenza virus, n = 3; rhinovirus, n = 3; metapneumovirus, n = 1; adenovirus, n = 1) admitted until January 2019.","We then did the antibody test on the stored blood of other patients who had confirmed viral infections, such as flu and common cold, before January 2019."
32766111,"Including the present case, four of 7 (57%) showed false-positive RIAT results due to human common cold coronaviruses infection.","Including the present case, four of 7 antibody test results were falsely positive for COVID-19.  "
32766111,"Two of the 4 patients showed initial negative to subsequent positive RIAT results, indicating seroconversion.",The high rate of the falsely positive antibody test results might be due to similarities between the human common cold coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.
32766111,RIAT was positive for IgG and IgM in viruses other than coronavirus in 2 (25.0%) and 1 (12.5%) patient.,The results of the antibody tests may depend on epidemics of human common cold coronavirus infection.
32766111,"Because of high incidence of false positive RIAT results, cross antigenicity between human common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 can be considered.",The spread of the past SARS-CoV-2 infections may be overestimated because of the falsely positive antibody test results.
33272198,"Background: Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health systems, citizens and policy makers worldwide."," It is hard to detect COVID-19 patients in a group of patients with common cold symptoms because there are no COVID-specific symptoms, there are not enough test supplies, and test results can be falsely negative in patients with COVID-19."
33272198,"Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19.",We aim to find some strong signs in the COVID test results that show SARS-CoV-2 infection.
33272198,"Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting.",We studied 374 patients who got rapid COVID tests.
33272198,Methods: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany.,"Patients were 31 to 59 years old, and one tenth of them had positive COVID-19 test results."
33272198,Results:,Patients who lost their sense pf smell had a higher chance to test positive for COVID-19.
33272198,"In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis.",Patients with a sore throat had a lower chance to test positive for COVID-19.
33272198,The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0-59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19.,Patients who had contact with an infected persons and had symptoms themselves also had an increased chance to test positive.
33272198,Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97).,"Even if they did not have symptoms, these patients had higher chances to test positive."
33773413,Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19.,Rapid diagnostic tests can support other COVID-q9 tests.
33773413,The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 ??C.,Rapid covid tests could be refrigerated or stored at room temperature under 30 degrees C (86 Fahrenheit)  
33773413,"In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 ??C.",We tested the accuracy of eleven rapid COVID tests that were stored and used at different temperatures.
33773413,"In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures.",The tests were stored for a short or long time at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 degrees C (35-39 Fahrenheit) or at 37 degrees C (98-99 Fahrenheit).
33773413,"We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 ??C or at 37 ??C.",The tests were stored for a long-term at recommended temperatures and then at the high temperature (37C) for 10 minutes.
33773413,The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0??106- 5.5??107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant.,"For five out of 11 rapid tests, the accuracy was reduced ten-fold."
33773413,"Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 ??C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization.","After 3 weeks of storage at high temperature (37 C), eight of the 11 rapid tests were ten-fold less accurate."
33773413,"After 3 weeks of storage at 37 ??C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity.",Two out of six rapid tests had false positive results at low temperatures (2-4 degrees C).
33773413,"Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 ??C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 ??C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO.","In summary, high temperatures reduced how well the test identified people who had COVID-19 and low temperatures caused false positive results, showing people who did not have COVID-19 as having it."
33773413,"In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs.",The false negative test results allow people who have the virus transmit it to others.
33773413,Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments.,Due to the false-positive results healthy people will be quarantined.
33773413,Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.,Storing the rapid tests at recommended temperatures is important during the pandemic.
35051204,Background: COVID-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic regardless of the countless efforts made by various actors.,COVID-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic.
35051204,Quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control.,Quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control.
35051204,"Notably, several commercially available one step RT-PCR based assays have been recommended by the WHO.",The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends some tests that detect COVID-19 virus.
35051204,"Yet, their analytic and diagnostic performances have not been well documented in resource-limited settings.",But we do not know how accurate these tests are.
35051204,"Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of three commercially available one step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in Ethiopia in clinical setting.","This study estimates accuracy of three commercial rapid tests in a clinical setting in Ethiopia From April to June 2021 we got 279 nasal swabs from community testing, contact cases and suspected cases.   "
35051204,"Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June, 2021 on 279 respiratory swabs originating from community surveillance, contact cases and suspect cases.","Among the 279 respiratory samples, 50, 59, and 69 tested positive by the three tests."
35051204,RNA was extracted using manual extraction method.,The tests agreed ranging from moderate to strong agreement.
35051204,"Master-mix preparation, amplification and result interpretation was done as per the respective manufacturer.","The tests accurately recognized people that did not have COVID (91 to 99 out of 100), but had more mistakes identifying people who had COVID, only 81 to 83 out of 100 sick people were found."
35051204,Agreements between RT-PCRs were analyzed using kappa values.,"All three tests were almost equal in identifying people with COVID-19, but one test was worse than the other two in identifying people without the disease."
34967441,"To investigate endogenous interference factors of the detection results of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgG. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG in sera of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection, including rheumatoid factor (RF) positive group, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive group, pregnant women group, and normal senior group, with 50 in each group and 100 normal controls.",Our aim is to find what could cause wrong COVID-19 test results.
34967441,"The level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in pregnant women was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (p = 0.000), but there was no significant difference between other groups.",Blood of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection was tested for proteins that protect against COVID-19 virus.
34967441,"The levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the pregnant women group, normal senior group, ANA positive group, and RF positive group were significantly higher than that in the normal control group (p < 0.05), with significant higher false-positive rates in these groups (p = 0.036, p = 0.004, p = 0.000, vs. normal control group).","100 of the patients were healthy, the others had proteins that could attack their own bodies or proteins associated with pregnancy, 50 each."
34967441,"Serum RF caused SARS-CoV-2 IgM false-positive in a concentration-dependent manner, especially when its concentration was higher than 110.25 IU/L, and the urea dissociation test can turn the false positive to negative.","Pregnant women had more of the common anti-COVID protein, but all other groups had the same amounts."
34967441,"ANA, normal seniors, pregnant women, and RF can lead to false-positive reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG detected using ELISA.","There was more anti-COVID protein the body makes when it fights a new infection in pregnant women, normal seniors, and people with proteins that attack their own body."
34967441,"These factors should be considered when SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG detection is positive, false positive samples caused by RF positive can be used for urea dissociation test.",These groups had significantly more false positive COVID test results.
34910739,"At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed, manufactured, and distributed the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed, provides rapid test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease."
34910739,"The diagnostic panel targeted three viral nucleocapsid gene loci (N1, N2, and N3 primers and probes) to maximize sensitivity and to provide redundancy for virus detection if mutations occurred.",The tests target different parts of the virus in case some parts of the virus change (mutate).
34910739,"After the first distribution of the diagnostic panel, state public health laboratories reported fluorescent signal in the absence of viral template (false-positive reactivity) for the N3 component and to a lesser extent for N1.",Parts of the test that target two specific parts of the virus may show false positive results -- identify people that do not have the virus as having it.
34910739,This report describes the findings of an internal investigation conducted by the CDC to identify the cause(s) of the N1 and N3 false-positive reactivity.,We report the results of the CDC analysis of the false positive tests..
34910739,"For N1, results demonstrate that contamination with a synthetic template, that occurred while the ""bulk"" manufactured materials were located in a research lab for quality assessment, was the cause of false reactivity in the first lot.","One part of the test that targeted one part of the virus was tainted with the material similar to that part when the test was produced, which caused false positive results."
34910739,Base pairing between the 3' end of the N3 probe and the 3' end of the N3 reverse primer led to amplification of duplex and larger molecules resulting in false reactivity in the N3 assay component.,"In another component of the test, some chemicals interacted with each other and caused false positive results."
34910739,"We conclude that flaws in both assay design and handling of the ""bulk"" material, caused the problems with the first lot of the 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.",We conclude that the first batch of CDC rapid tests had problems with the design of the test and manufacturing.
34910739,"In addition, within this study, we found that the age of the examined diagnostic panel reagents increases the frequency of false positive results for N3.",We found that the tests that were stored longer gave more false positive results.
34910739,"We discuss these findings in the context of improvements to quality control, quality assurance, and assay validation practices that have since been improved at the CDC.","After our study, CDC improved quality control and procedures for checking accuracy of the tests."
34758150,The aim was to determine the accuracy of anterior nasal swab in rapid antigen (Ag) tests in a low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and massive screened community.,We aim to find out how accurate the nasal swabs for rapid COVID-19 tests are in a large community with low rates of disease.
34758150,"Individuals, aged 18 years or older, who self-booked an appointment for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in March 2021 at a public test center in Copenhagen, Denmark were included.",Study participants were 18 years and older.
34758150,"An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR testing, followed by a swab from the anterior parts of the nose examined by Ag test (SD Biosensor).","They had an appointment for COVID-19 test in March 2021 in Copenhagen, Denmark."
34758150,Accuracy of the Ag test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference.,The swabs from their throat and nose were tested.
34758150,"We included 7074 paired conclusive tests (n = 3461, female: 50.7%).",We compared the accuracy of the rapid test using a nose swab to the throat test that used a tradiional testing method.
34758150,The median age was 48 years (IQR: 36-57 years).,We had 7074 paired reliable tests of which about half was for females.
34758150,"The prevalence was 0.9%, that is, 66 tests were positive on RT-PCR.",The age ranged from 36 to 57 years.
34758150,Thirty-two had a paired positive Ag test.,66 traditional throat tests (less than 1 percent) were positive.
34758150,The sensitivity was 48.5% and the specificity was 100%.,"For 32 of these, the rapid nasal test was also positive."
34758150,"This study conducted in a low prevalence setting in a massive screening set-up showed that the Ag test had a sensitivity of 48.5% and a specificity of 100%, that is, no false positive tests.",We did not have any false positive tests.
34758150,The lower sensitivity is a challenge especially if Ag testing is not repeated frequently allowing this scalable test to be a robust supplement to RT-PCR testing in an ambitious public SARS-CoV-2 screening.,Overlooking more than half of the patients with the disease is a problem.
34668722,Antigen-based rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) are useful tools for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection.,Rapid diagnostics tests are useful for detecting COVID-19 virus.
34668722,"However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products.",Misleading demos of the rapid test on social media showed it can find COVID-19 virus in the tap water and food.
34668722,"To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside manufacturer recommendations.","To fight misleading information, we studied the results of the rapid tests that did not follow testing rules."
34668722,"Using Panbio, various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested with and without manufacturer buffer.","We did the test in a wrong way on water, food, other liquids and samples without the COVID-19 virus."
34668722,"Additional experiments were conducted to assess the role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and Tween 20) as well as the impact of temperature (4??C, 20??C, and 45??C) and humidity (90%) on assay performance.",We also studied how different temperatures and humidity change test results.
34668722,Direct sample testing (without the kit buffer) resulted in false-positive signals resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2 positive controls tested under proper conditions.,Doing the test wrong caused false positive results saying there is COVID-19 virus in the materials that did not have it.
34668722,"The likely explanation of these artifacts is nonspecific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon, and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under conditions promoting artifact formation.",False results may happen because the parts of the test change if the test is done wrong.  
34668722,"Omitting, altering, and reverse engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function.",The test changed less in extremes of temperature and humidity.
34668722,"Interestingly, the Panbio assay could tolerate some extremes of temperature and humidity outside manufacturer claims.",Our study supports strictly following the test instructions to reduce false positive results of COVID-19 rapid test.
34668722,"Our data support strict adherence to manufacturer instructions to avoid false-positive SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT reactions, otherwise resulting in anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and dissemination of misinformation.","False positive results increase anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and spread of rumors."
34668722,IMPORTANCE:,The Panbio rapid COVID-19 test that we studied is used in over 120 countries worldwide.
34668722,"With the Panbio severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test being deployed in over 120 countries worldwide, understanding conditions required for its ideal performance is critical.",It is very important to understand how to get accurate test results.
34668722,"Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed.","Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed."
34668722,"While erroneous results from improper use of a test may not be surprising to some health care professionals, understanding why false positives occur can help reduce the propagation of misinformation and provide a scientific rebuttal for these aberrant findings.",Health professionals know that not doing the tests right causes errors in the results.
34668722,"This study demonstrated that the kit buffer's pH, ionic strength, and buffering capacity were critical components to ensure proper kit function and avoid generation of false-positive results.",Knowing what causes the errors will help them explain the errors and stop rumors.
34668722,"Typically, false positives arise from cross-reacting or interfering substances; however, this study demonstrated a mechanism where false positives were generated under conditions favoring nonspecific interactions between the two antibodies designed for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.",Many different parts of the test need to work properly to avoid mistakes.
34668722,Following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.,"In many cases, test errors are caused by the chemicals our bodies have to fight other infections or some other chemicals that accidentally got into the test."
34558034,Positive retests of COVID-19 represent a public health concern because of the increased risk of transmission.,Repeated positive COVID-19 tests show that the risk of new people getting the disease is growing.
34558034,This study explored whether factors other than the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) contribute to positive retest results.,We studied what causes positive test results.
34558034,"Patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Guanggu district of the Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital between February 17 and March 28, 2020, were retrospectively included.",We studied children with COVID-19 who were at the hospital in February - March 2020.
34558034,The patients were grouped into the negative (n = 133) and positive (n = 51) retest groups.,133 children had negative rpeated COVID-19 test results and 51 had positive results.
34558034,The results showed that the proportion of patients presenting with cough was higher (P < 0.001) and the proportion of patients with dyspnea was lower (P = 0.018) in the positive than in the negative retest group.,"Among patients with repeated positive tests, there were more with cough and fewer with shortness of breath, compared to patients with the negative test."
34558034,The positive retest group showed shorter durations between symptom onset and hospitalization (P < 0.001) and symptom onset and the first positive NAAT (P = 0.033).,Patients who had symptoms and repeated positive tests were admitted to the hospital and had positive test results earlier.
34558034,The positive retest group had higher basophil counts (P = 0.023) and direct bilirubin (P = 0.032) and chlorine concentrations (P = 0.023) but lower potassium concentrations (P = 0.001) than the negative retest group.,People who had repeated positive tests also had different blood test results compared to the people with negative tests.
34558034,"Multivariable regression analysis showed that coughing (OR = 7.59, 95% CI 2.28-25.32, P = 0.001) and serum chloride concentrations (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77, P = 0.010) were independently associated with a positive retest result.",Coughing and a certain blood test result were each associated with a positive retest result.
34558034,Coughing and serum chloride concentrations were independent risk factors for positive NAAT retest results.,Patients who stayed at the hospital for less than 2 weeks or had symptoms shortly after getting COVID-19 should be quarantined.
34558034,Patients with a hospital stay of < 2 weeks or a short incubation period should stay in isolation and be monitored to reduce transmission.,These results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.
33983916,"Prompt and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of COVID-19, including in hospital settings (1-3).","Fast and accurate COVID-19 tests help reduce the spread of the disease, including in hospitals."
33983916,"In vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.","Some of the known tests are expensive, take a long time and need training to do the test."
33983916,*,Other tests are fast and easy to do without training.
33983916,Antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive.,Accuracy of the easier and faster tests compared to the traditional tests is an area of interest.
33983916,"The performance?? of antigen detection tests, compared with that of NAATs, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",The Quidel rapid test was approved for emergency use in patients within the first 5 days of COVID-19 symptoms.
33983916,The Quidel Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) received Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4).,These tests agreed with the traditional test for 83 to 99 out of 100 patients with positive results and 97 to all 100 patients with negative results.
33983916,The reported test positive percentage agreement?? between this test and an RT-PCR test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval,"For the COVID-19 patients that did not have symptoms, the tests were not as accurate as the traditional test."
33983916,"[CI] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% CI = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.?? However, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing.",We compared test results at a hospital in June - August 2020.
33983916,"Data collected during June 30-August 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of RT-PCR in a hospital setting.","Among 1,732 patients that had no symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on about 60 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests."
33983916,"Among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with RT-PCR.","Among 307 patients that had symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on over 70 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests."
33983916,"Among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively.","As rapid test misses many COVID-19 cases, traditional tests might be needed when the disease is on the rise."
33983916,"Health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory NAAT testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.",False negative test results cause delays in quarantine and treatment of COVID-19.
234488,A double-blind crossover study of inhibition of histamine-induced pruritus by three commonly prescribed antihistamines was conducted on 28 normal subjects.,"Three commonly prescribed drugs (antihistamines) for itching caused by histamine, a chemical the body releases during allergic reactions, were studied on 28 healthy people."
234488,"Drugs used included diphenhydramine HCl (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), hydroxyzine HCl (Atarax), and a lactose placebo in identical capsules.","The drugs in identical capsules included Benadryl, Periactin, Atarax, and a placebo (a pill that contains no drug)."
234488,Intradermal histamine dose-response thresholds of pruritus were obtained before and after pretreatment with the three antihistamines and placebo in each subject.,The thresholds of itching due to histamine were measured before and after taking the drugs.
234488,Analysis of data revealed a fivefold increase above baseline of the histamine dose required to produce pruritus following both cyproheptadine and placebo.,"For Periactin and placebo, the dose of histamine that caused itching increased fivefold."
234488,This compared to a tenfold increase following diphenhydramine and a 750-fold increase following hydroxyzine HCl.,"For Benadryl, the dose had to be 10 times higher, and for Atarax 750 times higher."
234488,"The most common side effect was drowsiness, which occurred with all three drugs.","The most common side effect was drowsiness, which occurred with all three drugs."
33141610,"Background: This study aimed to measure the association of various H1-antihistamines (H1A) with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), and present a comprehensive overview of H1A-induced TdP cases reported to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).",We studied relations between antihistamines (drugs for treating allergies) and Torsade de Pointes (very fast heart rhythm) as reported to the FDA.
33141610,Methods: All H1A-induced TdP cases (n = 406) were retrieved from the FAERS database using the preferred term 'Torsade de Pointes' of MedDRA version-22 from 1990 to 2019.,We found 406 reports on Torsade de Pointes and antihistamines.
33141610,Four data-mining algorithms were used for disproportionality analysis:,We used four different statistical methods to study the cases.
33141610,Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR);,Antihistamines that had more than three reports of torsade de pointes were included in the analysis.
33141610,"Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM), and Information Content (IC).",We found 12 drugs associated with torsade de pointes.
33141610,H1A with >3 TdP cases were included.,Six of the drugs were not known before to cause torsade de pointes.
33141610,Results:,Getting antihistamines with other drugs that cause heart complications was lower than for the known antihistamines.
33141610,"A total of 12 signals (Astemizole, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, loratadine, meclizine, promethazine, terfenadine, and trimeprazine) were identified including six new signals (cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, loratadine, and meclizine).",The new antihistamines were associated with heart complications stronger than the known ones.
33141610,The number of risk factors (p = 0.031) and concomitant QT-prolonging drugs (p = <0.001) were significantly lower among new signals vs old signals.,The new antihistamines were associated with torsade de pointes stronger.
28480041,"Several noncardiac drugs have been linked to cardiac safety concerns, highlighting the importance of post-marketing surveillance and continued evaluation of the benefit-risk of long-established drugs.",Several drugs can cause heart problems.
28480041,"Here, we examine the risk of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with the use of hydroxyzine, a first generation sedating antihistamine.",It is important to monitor and evaluate risks of traditional drugs.
28480041,"We have used a combined methodological approach to re-evaluate the cardiac safety profile of hydroxyzine, including: (1) a full review of the sponsor pharmacovigilance safety database to examine real-world data on the risk of QT prolongation and/or TdP associated with hydroxyzine use and (2) nonclinical electrophysiological studies to examine concentration-dependent effects of hydroxyzine on a range of human cardiac ion channels.","We study if taking hydroxyzine, a drug that relieves anxiety and also itch caused by allergies, is associated with fast, chaotic heartbeats."
28480041,"Based on a review of pharmacovigilance data between 14th December 1955 and 1st August 2016, we identified 59 reports of QT prolongation and/or TdP potentially linked to hydroxyzine use.",We reviewed data from a drug safety database and the basic studies of hydroxyzine interactions with human cells.
28480041,"Aside from intentional overdose, all cases involved underlying medical conditions or concomitant medications that constituted at least 1 additional risk factor for such events.",The drug safety data had 59 reports between December 1955 and August 2016 that linked fast chaotic heartbeats to hydroxyzine use.
28480041,The combination of cardiovascular disorders plus concomitant treatment of drugs known to induce arrhythmia was identified as the greatest combined risk factor.,Some people took too much of the drug (overdose).
28480041,"Parallel patch-clamp studies demonstrated hydroxyzine concentration-dependent inhibition of several human cardiac ion channels, including the ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium ion channels.",All other cases had medical problems or were taking other drugs along with hydroxyzine.
28480041,"Results from this analysis support the listing of hydroxyzine as a drug with ""conditional risk of TdP"" and are in line with recommendations to limit hydroxyzine use in patients with known underlying risk factors for QT prolongation and/or TdP.",People who have heart problems and take drugs that can cause irregular heartbeat are at the greatest risk of complications due to hydroxyzine.
1683192,"First-generation antihistamines have potency, pharmacokinetic, and cost advantages compared with nonsedating second-generation antihistamines.",First-generation antihistamines (allergy drugs that cause drowsiness) are more powerful and cheaper than the second-generation antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness.
1683192,Bedtime dosing of hydroxyzine was investigated as a dosing strategy to minimize reaction time degradation and adverse subjective symptoms previously documented for hydroxyzine in divided doses.,Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that is used to relieve itching caused by allergies.
1683192,"Hydroxyzine, 50 mg qhs, was compared with terfenadine, 60 mg bid, in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 15 healthy, asymptomatic adults.",We studied if taking hydroxyzine at bedtime reduces the side effects known to be caused by taking this drug divided in small doses.
1683192,Computer-based eye-hand reaction time tests of simple reaction time (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) were not statistically different among the three drugs.,15 healthy adults took hydroxyzine every night at bedtime or another antihistamine terfenadine or a pill that contained no drugs two times a day.  
1683192,"Drowsiness, dry mouth, and irritability were significant for hydroxyzine (P = .0001, .001 and .02, respectively) compared with terfenadine or placebo, but less than seen in a previous study of hydroxyzine, 25 mg bid.","Hydroxyzine caused drowsiness, dry mouth and moodiness more than terfenadine or placebo, but less than taking hydroxyzine twice a day."
1683192,Symptom scores with terfenadine were comparable to placebo.,Symptoms caused by terfenadine and placebo were about the same.
1683192,Histamine skin test wheal and flare were both significantly and comparably suppressed by hydroxyzine and terfenadine (P = .0001).,Both hydroxyzine and terfenadine lessened allergic reactions.
1683192,"While wheal suppression by hydroxyzine was universal, four of the 15 subjects showed little or no suppression with terfenadine (P = .03).","Hydroxyzine lessened allergic reactions in all people, but terfenadine failed to lessen the reaction in four of the 15 people."
1683192,"Although bedtime dosing of hydroxyzine did not eliminate subjective symptoms, it maintained skin H1-receptor antagonism the following morning and alleviated the prolongation of reaction times previously reported with hydroxyzine in divided doses.",Taking hydroxyzine at bedtime somewhat lessened the symptoms and relieved skin itching the next morning.
1683192,The significant adverse subjective symptoms and psychomotor performance degradations caused by first-generation antihistamines can be mitigated by creative dosing schedules.,The side effects lasted not as long as with taking the drug twice daily.
8792380,"Although older, potentially sedating, ""first-generation"" antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are commonly used in childhood, their central nervous system (CNS) effects have not been well-documented in young subjects.","First generation antihistamines, drugs that stop allergies due to the body chemical histamine, may cause drowsiness."
8792380,We hypothesized that diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine would affect CNS function adversely in this population.,"They are often given to children, but it is not known how they effect the children's brains We believe that first generation antihistamines diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine may disturb children's brain function."
8792380,Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these medications on central and peripheral histamine H1-receptors in children.,We evaluated how these drugs effect body cells in children.
8792380,"Fifteen subjects with allergic rhinitis were tested before and 2-2.5 h after administration of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo in a double-blind, single-dose, three-way crossover study.","Fifteen children with seasonal allergy (hay fever) had tests before and after they took diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs.)"
8792380,Impairment of cognitive processing was assessed objectively by the latency of the P300 event-related potential (P300).,Their brain functions were evaluated by measuring the delays in response to events.
8792380,Somnolence was assessed subjectively by a visual analog scale.,They were also asked to evaluate how sleepy they felt.  
8792380,Peripheral H1-blockade was assessed by suppression of the histamine-induced wheals and flares.,Diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine significantly increased the time it took to respond to the events.
8792380,"At the central (Cz) and frontal (Fz) electrodes, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine increased the P300 latency significantly (P < 0.05) compared to baseline.",Hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine also increased sleepiness.
8792380,"Hydroxyzine increased somnolence, as recorded on the visual analog scale, significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.05), with a similar trend for diphenhydramine (P = 0.07).",Both antihistamines also reduced the allergies.
8792380,Both antihistamines reduced histamine-induced wheals and flares significantly compared to baseline and compared to placebo.,"In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine help against allergies, but interfere with brain functions."
8792380,"In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine are effective H1-receptor antagonists, but both these medications cause CNS dysfunction, as evidenced by increased P300 latency, a measure of cognitive function, and by increased subjective somnolence.","These drugs cause longer response times, increase sleepiness and disturb mental processes."
7913608,"First-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), frequently cause somnolence or other CNS adverse effects.","First-generation antihistamines, drugs that help with allergies caused by histamine, a chemical profited by our bodies, often cause sleepiness and disturb brain functions in other ways."
7913608,"Second-generation H1-antagonists, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, represent a true advance in therapeutics.","These drugs include diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine and chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine)."
7913608,"In manufacturers' recommended doses, they have a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than their predecessors with regard to lack of CNS effects, and do not exacerbate the adverse CNS effects of alcohol or other CNS-active chemicals.","Second-generation antihistamines, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, are better."
7913608,"Rarely, some of the newer H1-antagonists may cause cardiac dysrhythmias after overdose or under other specific conditions.","These drugs do not disturb brain functions when taken alone, and do not strengthen the disturbances caused by alcohol or other chemicals."
7913608,The concept of a risk-free H1-antagonist is proving to be an oversimplification.,"Not often, the new antihistamines may cause heart rhythm disturbances; if a person takes too much of the drug or has other specific conditions."
7913608,An H1-antagonist absolutely free from adverse effects under all circumstances is not yet available for use.,Taking any antihistamines includes some risks.  
7913608,"The magnitude of the beneficial effects of each H1-antagonist should be related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the CNS and cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be developed for each medication in this class.","When taking antihistamines, people should consider the benefits and the risks carefully."
29532516,Objective: Antihistamines often have sedative side effects.,"Antihistamines, drugs that help with allergies, often cause drowsiness."
29532516,This was the first study to measure regional cerebral glucose (energy) consumption and hemodynamic responses in young adults during cognitive tests after antihistamine administration.,We studied young adults' brains during tests of mental processes after taking antihistamines.
29532516,"Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study, 18 healthy young Japanese men received single doses of levocetirizine 5 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg at intervals of at least six days.",18 healthy young Japanese men took antihistamines levocetirizine and diphenhydramine at least six days apart.
29532516,"Subjective feeling, task performances, and brain activity were evaluated during three cognitive tests (word fluency, two-back, and Stroop).","Their well-being, task performances, and brain activity were measured while checking their mental functions.  "
29532516,Regional cerebral glucose consumption changes were measured using positron emission tomography with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose.,"After diphenhydramine, the brains consumed more energy but responded slower."
29532516,Regional hemodynamic responses were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy.,"Diphenhydramine, but not levocetirizine, lowered the accuracy of mental processes."
29532516,"Results: Energy consumption in prefrontal regions was significantly increased after antihistamine administration, especially diphenhydramine, whereas prefrontal hemodynamic responses, evaluated with oxygenated hemoglobin levels, were significantly lower with diphenhydramine treatment.",There was no difference in sleepiness.
29532516,"Stroop test accuracy was significantly impaired by diphenhydramine, but not by levocetirizine.",Antihistamines may effect human brain.  
7486360,"Study objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a 4-day ""burst"" course of prednisone added to standard treatment with H1 antihistamines for the management of acute urticaria in outpatients.","This study added hormone prednisone to antihistamines, the drugs that are usually used to treat hives (itchy skin rash).  "
7486360,"Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial.",Adults with the rash that started no more than 24 hours ago participated in the study.
7486360,Setting: Emergency department of an urban tertiary care teaching hospital.,"Patients with wheezing, raspy breathing, swelling or those who took antihistamines or hormones within 5 days before coming to the emergency room were not included in the study."
7486360,"Participants: Adult patients with urticarial rash of no more than 24 hours' duration, regardless of cause.",Diabetics and people with ulcers (open sores in the stomach) were not included too.
7486360,"Patients were excluded if they manifested wheezing, stridor, or angioedema or if they had taken antihistamines or glucocorticoids within 5 days of arrival at the ED.","All patients were asked to give their itch an ""itch score"" on a scale."
7486360,Patients also were excluded if there was a history of diabetes or active peptic ulcer disease.,Patients then got a shot of an antihistamine diphenhydramine and were sent home.
7486360,"Interventions: All patients were asked to evaluate the severity of pruritus (""itch score"") on a 10-cm visual analog scale.",They took an antihistamine hydroxyzine every 4 to 8 hours for their itch.
7486360,"Patients were then given diphenhydramine, 50 mg intramuscularly, and discharged home on a regimen of hydroxyzine, 25 mg orally, every 4 to 8 hours for pruritus, plus either prednisone, 20 mg, or placebo orally every 12 hours for 4 days.",Patients also took another pill every 12 hours for 4 days.
7486360,"Patients' conditions were reassessed clinically, with itch score calculated again 2 days later, and again at 5 days by telephone.","For some that pill was the hormone prednisone, and for some it was a placebo (did not contain any drug)."
7486360,Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled; 24 received prednisone and 19 received placebo.,Patients came back to evaluate their each score 2 days later.
7486360,"The two groups had similar itch scores at enrollment (prednisone, 8.1 +/- 1.7; placebo, 7.4 +/- 2.1, P = .25",5 days later the score was evaluated by phone.
7486360,"[ANOVA]), but at 2- and 5-day follow-up the prednisone group had significantly lower itch scores (1.3 +/- 1.3 and .0","Out of f43 patients, 24 got prednisone and 19 placebo."

7486360,".0 versus 4.4 +/- 2.2 and 1.6 +/- 1.0, respectively; P < .0001","After 2 and 5 days, those who had prednisone had lower itch scores and less rash."
7486360,[ANCOVA] at each interval) and greater clinical improvement in rash.,"Patients' age, sex, and substances that caused allergies did not effect the itch score."
7486360,"Response did not correlate with age, sex, or identification of an allergen.",No patients had adverse reactions.
7486360,No adverse effects were noted in either group.,Adding prednisone improves antihistamine treatment of hives.
7486360,Conclusion: The addition of a prednisone burst improves the symptomatic and clinical response of acute urticaria to antihistamines.,"When prednisone was added, the skin cleared faster and more completely."
7486360,"Patients' conditions improved more quickly and more completely when prednisone was administered, without any apparent adverse effects.",There were no side effects.
2866055,"This article reviews clinical pharmacokinetic data on the H1-receptor antagonists, commonly referred to as the antihistamines.",This is a review of the drugs called antihistamines because they help with allergies caused by the body chemical histamine.
2866055,"Despite their widespread use over an extended period, relatively little pharmacokinetic data are available for many of these drugs.","These drugs are used widely, but little is known about their interactions with human body.   "
2866055,A number of H1-receptor antagonists have been assayed mainly using radioimmunoassay methods.,The max amount of antihistamines gets into the blood 2 to 3 hours after taking a pill or syrup.
2866055,These have also generally measured metabolites to greater or lesser extents.,"The amounts of the drug that made it into the blood were about a third of the taken pill for chlorpheniramine, about half for diphenhydramine, and about a quarter for promethazine."
2866055,"Thus, the interpretation of such data is complex.",Most of these drugs are processed in the body by the liver.
2866055,"After oral administration of H1-receptor antagonists as syrup or tablet formulations, peak plasma concentrations are usually observed after 2 to 3 hours.",These drugs are usually removed from the body at a rate of 5 to 12 milliliters per minute for each kilogram of body weight.
2866055,"Bioavailability has not been extensively studied, but is about 0.34 for chlorpheniramine, 0.40 to 0.60 for diphenhydramine, and about 0.25 for promethazine.",Half of the total amount of the drug is taken out of the body from about 3 hours to about 20 days.
2866055,"Most of these drugs are metabolised in the liver, this being very extensive in some instances (e.g. cyproheptadine and terfenadine).","For cinnarizine it's about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole about 7 to 20 days, when taken for a long time; and for flunarizine about 18 to 20 days."
2866055,"Total body clearance in adults is generally in the range of 5 to 12 ml/min/kg (for astemizole, brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, promethazine and triprolidine), while their elimination half-lives range from about 3 hours to about 18 days [cinnarizine about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole and its active metabolites about 7 to 20 days (after long term administration); flunarizine about 18 to 20 days].","These drugs tend to go from the blood into the body tissues, meaning that a higher dose of a drug is needed to keep its levels in the blood."
2866055,They also have relatively large apparent volumes of distribution in excess of 4 L/kg.,"In children, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine go to half of the amount in the body faster than in adults."
2866055,"In children, the elimination half-lives of chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine are shorter than in adults.","In patients with liver disease due to alcohol, time to get half of the diphenhydramine out lengthens from 9 to 15 hours."
2866055,"In patients with alcohol-related liver disease, the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine was increased from 9 to 15 hours, while in patients with chronic renal disease that of chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged.","In patients with kidney disease, time to get out chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged."
2866055,"Little, if any, published information is available on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in neonates, pregnancy or during lactation.","Almost nothing is known about these drugs in the bodies of newborns, and pregnant or breastfeeding women."
2866055,"The relatively long half-lives of a number of the older H1-receptor antagonists such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine suggest that they can be administered to adults once daily.","Because half of the drug stays in the body longer for the older antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, they can be given to adults once daily."
15507061,Objectives: To determine the national rate and trend of inappropriate medication administration to elderly emergency department (ED) patients.,We studied inappropriate use of drugs in elderly patients in the emergency departments.
15507061,Secondary objectives were to identify risk factors for receiving an inappropriate medication and to determine whether administration is sometimes justified based on diagnosis.,We also find out what causes inappropriate use of drugs and if it is sometimes done for a good reason.
15507061,Design:,We studied visits to emergency departments in 1992-2000.
15507061,Retrospective analysis of ED visits in the 1992-2000 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.,Drugs that are dangerous for elderly and should be used with caution were listed by Dr. Beers in 1997.   
15507061,Inappropriate medications identified using Beers' 1997 explicit criteria.,Drugs from the Beers' list were given about 16 million times (over a tenth of emergency visits by elderly) from 1992 to 2000.
15507061,Setting: EDs of U.S. noninstitutionalized general and short-stay hospitals.,"Six drugs accounted for the majority of inappropriate use: promethazine, meperidine, propoxyphene, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, and diazepam."
15507061,Participants: ED survey patients aged 65 and older.,There were almost no indications that the use of these drugs was potentially appropriate.
15507061,Measurements: Magnitude and rate of administration of 36 medications.,"For example, less than half of patients that got diphenhydramine and less than 10th that got hydroxyzine had allergies."
15507061,Results:,Elderly patients often get inappropriate drugs in the emergency room.
15507061,Inappropriate medications were administered in an estimated 16.1 million (95% confidence interval (CI)=14.9-17.3 million) or 12.6% (95% CI=11.6-13.5%) of elderly ED visits from 1992 to 2000.,Potentially appropriate uses do not account for the given drugs.
15507061,The rate of inappropriate administration was unchanged throughout the study period (P=.40).,"Although the list of inappropriate drugs was published in 1997, it has not changed how the drugs are given."
24197658,The objective of this study was to examine the associations between aromatase inhibitor therapy and hair loss or hair thinning among female breast cancer survivors.,This study examines the links between aromatase inhibitor therapy (drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer) and hair loss or hair thinning among female breast cancer survivors.
24197658,Data were analyzed from 851 female breast cancer survivors who responded to a hospital registry-based survey.,We analyzed data from 851 female breast cancer survivors who responded to a hospital survey.
24197658,"Data on hair loss, hair thinning, demographic characteristics, and health habits were based on self-report; data on aromatase inhibitor therapy were collected on the survey and verified using medical record review.","Data on hair loss, hair thinning, background information, and health habits were self-reported."
24197658,"Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between aromatase inhibitor therapy and the hair outcome variables adjusted for potential confounders, including age and chemotherapy treatment.",Data on aromatase inhibitor therapy were collected by the survey and verified with medical records.
24197658,The results showed that 22.4 % of the breast cancer survivors reported hair loss and 31.8 % reported hair thinning.,"The relationship between aromatase inhibitor therapy and hair outcome was mathematically estimated and adjusted for possible misleading variables, like age and chemotherapy treatment."
24197658,"In the confounder-adjusted analyses, breast cancer survivors who were within 2 years of starting aromatase inhibitor treatment at the time of survey completion were approximately two and a half times more likely to report reporting hair loss (OR 2.55; 95 % CI 1.19-5.45) or hair thinning (OR 2.33; 95 % CI 1.10-4.93) within the past 4 weeks compared to those who were never treated with an aromatase inhibitor.",22.4% of the breast cancer survivors reported hair loss.
24197658,"Current aromatase inhibitor use for two or more years at the time of the survey and prior use were significantly associated with hair thinning (current users, ???2 years:",31.8% reported hair thinning.
24197658,"OR 1.86; prior users: OR 1.62), but not hair loss.",Breast cancer survivors who were within 2 years of starting aromatase inhibitor treatment at the time of the survey were around two and a half times more likely to report hair loss or thinning in the past 4 weeks compared to those never treated with an aromatase inhibitor.
24197658,Findings from this study suggest that aromatase inhibitor use is associated with an increased risk of hair loss and hair thinning independent of chemotherapy and age; these side effects are likely due to the substantial decrease in estrogen concentrations resulting from treatment with this drug.,Current aromatase inhibitor use for 2 or more years at the time of the survey and past use were linked with hair thinning but not hair loss.
24197658,Future research should focus on examining these associations in a prospective manner using more detailed and objective measures of hair loss and thinning.,Findings from the study suggest that aromatase inhibitor use is linked with an increased risk of hair loss and thinning regardless of chemotherapy and age.
29641806,Importance:,The study's importance is based on the fact that endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (EIA) (hair loss or thinning from hormonal therapy) has been mentioned but not measured.
29641806,Endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (EIA) has been anecdotally reported but not systematically described.,The study's objective is to describe EIA thoroughly in patients with breast cancer.
29641806,Objective: To characterize EIA in patients with breast cancer.,"The study's design is a study of 112 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with EIA from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016."
29641806,"Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective cohort study of 112 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with EIA from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2016, the patients were examined at the dermatology service in a large tertiary care hospital and comprehensive cancer center.","The patients were examined at a skin center in a large, specialized hospital and professional cancer center."

29641806,Data from the Hairdex Questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the alopecia on patients QoL.  Higher score indicates lower QoL (0-100 score).,We used data from the Hairdex Questionnaire (a questionnaire for disease-specific quality of life measurements) to measure the impact of hair loss or thinning (alopecia) on patients QoL. Higher scores indicate lower QoL (0-100 score).
29641806,Efficacy of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by a single-blinded investigator through standardized clinical photographs of the scalp.,The success of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups through standard photographs of the scalp.
29641806,Results:,112 female patients with breast cancer were included.
29641806,"A total of 112 female patients with breast cancer were included (median [range] age, 60",Their median age was 60 years with a range from 34-90 years.
29641806,[34-90] years).,104 patients (93%) had standard photographs.
29641806,"A total of 104 patients (93%) had standardized clinical photographs; of these, 59 patients (53%) had trichoscopy images available at baseline, and 46 patients (41%) were assessed for response to minoxidil.","Of these, 59 patients (53%) had images from special hair and scalp evaluations at the start."
29641806,Alopecia was attributed to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%) and tamoxifen in 37 (33%).,46 patients (41%) were measured for response to minoxidil.
29641806,"Severity was grade 1 in 96 of 104 patients (92%), and the pattern was similar to androgenetic alopecia.",Alopecia was linked to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) in 37 (33%).
29641806,The predominant trichoscopic feature at baseline was the presence of vellus hairs and intermediate- and thick-diameter terminal hair shafts.,Severity was low in 96 of 104 patients (92%).
29641806,"A negative impact on QoL was reported, with a higher effect in the emotion domain according to the Hairdex score (mean [SD], 41.8","The pattern was similar to common, receding hair loss."
29641806,[21.3]; P < .001).,"The most common scalp and hair-related feature at the start were peach fuzz and mid- and thick, long hairs on the scalp."
29641806,"After treatment with topical minoxidil, moderate or significant improvement in alopecia was observed in 37 of 46 patients (80%).","QoL was negatively reported, especially in the emotional part of life."

29641806,"A significant negative impact on QoL was reported by patients, despite mostly mild alopecia severity.","In conclusion, hormonal therapies are linked with commonly-seen hair loss and thinning, similar to agents that actively cause alopecia."
27247882,Endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (ETIHL) associated with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen treatment is currently mostly reported but remained an unresolved therapeutic issue in patients with breast cancer (BC) since the number of studies regarding the management is limited in literature.,Endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (ETIHL) (hair loss from hormonal therapy) linked with aromatase inhibitors (drugs used to treat breast cancer) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) is reported but remains unsolved in patients with breast cancer (BC).
27247882,Herein we investigated the possible causes of this clinical problem and its relation with endocrine therapies widely used for BC survivors and made some modest practical recommendations in light of the literature review in order to provide an optimal management.,This is largely because the number of studies regarding this hair loss management is limited.
27247882,"On the basis of literature findings, common causes of hair loss apart from endocrine therapies should be investigated with an initial evaluation workup and then should be corrected, if observed.",We checked the possible causes of this medical problem and its link to hormonal therapies used for BC survivors.
27247882,Treatment with topical 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and supplementation of Vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids are likely appeared to be the most appropriate treatment agents for ETIHL without causing an adverse effect on BC prognosis.,We also made practical recommendations based on relevant medical studies to provide optimal management.
27247882,"However, more prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled studied are required in order to confirm our results and also identify the clinical effects of this problem on patients with BC.","Based on medical papers, common causes of hair loss besdies hormonal therapies should be checked with a starting evaluation workup and then corrected if found."

25473228,"Three patients demonstrated male pattern alopecia with receding frontal hairlines, and two patients demonstrated female pattern alopecia without receding hairlines.",Three patients showed alopecia common to males with receding hairlines in the front.
25473228,The detailed clinical history showed that the pattern alopecia of the patients developed after the full recovery of global hair loss of the entire scalp due to previous cytotoxic chemotherapy.,Two patients showed alopecia common to females without receding hairlines.
25473228,"All of the adjuvant hormonal anticancer drugs that were used in the patients are antiestrogenic agents, either aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor modulators.","The patient history showed that common alopecia of the patients developed after full recovery of complete hair loss of the scalp due to prior, severe chemotherapy (cancer treatment)."
25473228,"Considering androgen effect on the hair follicles of the fronto-parietal scalp, the androgen-estrogen imbalance caused by the drugs was thought to be the reason for the onset of pattern alopecia in the patients.","All of the secondary hormonal anticancer drugs used in patients are antiestrogenic agents (which influence levels of estrogen, a female sex hormone)."
25473228,"In general, alopecia that develops during cytotoxic chemotherapy is well known to both physicians and patients; however, the diagnosis of pattern alopecia during hormonal anticancer therapy in breast cancer patients seems to be overlooked.",These agents include aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor modulators.
30464397,Background and objective: Anastrozole is a well-established active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (BC) in postmenopausal women.,"For background, anastrozole is an important drug ingredient for treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (BC) in women who have finished their last period."
30464397,"However, treatment with the only available oral formulation is often associated with concentration-dependent serious side effects such as hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others.","However, treatment with the only available drug taken by mouth is linked with serious side effects that worsen with greater doses."
30464397,"In contrast, a sustained-release system for the local application of anastrozole should minimize these serious adverse drug reactions.","These side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others."
30464397,"Methods: Anastrozole-in-adhesive transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) were developed offering efficient loading, avoidance of inhomogeneity or crystallization of the drug, the desired controlled release kinetics, storage stability, easy handling, mechanical stability, and sufficient stickiness on the skin.","In contrast, a steady release of anastrozole could minimize these serious side effects from the drug."
30464397,In vitro continuous anastrozole release profiles were studied in Franz diffusion cells.,"Anastrozole administered by a patch on the skin was created for efficient administration, avoiding drug crystals in the body, desired drug release, storage ease, easy handling, stability, and stickiness on the skin."
30464397,"In vivo, consecutive drug plasma kinetics from the final anastrozole transdermal system was tested in beagle dogs.","Continuous anastrozole treatment was studied in cells designed to measure the success of oils, creams, and gels."

30464397,"In vivo data showed a favorable anastrozole plasma concentration-time course, avoiding side effect-associated peak concentrations as obtained after oral administration but matching therapeutic plasma levels up to 72 h. Conclusion: These results provide the basis for establishing the transdermal application of anastrozole with improved pharmacokinetics and drug safety as novel therapeutic approach and promising option to treat human BC by decreasing the high burden of unwanted side effects.","Data in living animals showed good anastrozole blood concentration overtime, avoiding the worst of side effects linked with treatment by mouth but matching its helpful blood levels up to 72 hours."
20821047,Previous studies have demonstrated that both anastrozole and letrozole are well tolerated.,Previous studies showed that both anastrozole and letrozole (drugs to treat breast cancer) are well tolerated.
20821047,Letrozole suppresses estrogen to a greater degree than anastrozole in the serum and breast tumor.,Letrozole reduces estrogen (a female sex hormone) more than anastrozole in the blood and breast tumor.
20821047,Concerns have been raised that greater potency may adversely affect patients' quality of life (QOL).,There are concerns that its greater strength may harm patients' quality of life (QOL).

24037977,Background:,"For the study's background, while the frequency of alopecia (hair loss or thinning) to powerful chemotherapies (cancer-treating treatments) has been well described, the frequency of alopecia during hormonal therapies (i.e., anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors used to treat breast cancer) has not been described."
24037977,"Whereas the frequency of alopecia to cytotoxic chemotherapies has been well described, the incidence of alopecia during endocrine therapies (i.e., anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors) has not been investigated.","Hormonal agents are widely used in the treatment and prevention of many solid tumors, mainly those of the breast and prostrate."
24037977,"Endocrine agents are widely used in the treatment and prevention of many solid tumors, principally those of the breast and prostate.","Sticking to these therapies is not the best, In part due to toxicities."
24037977,"Adherence to these therapies is suboptimal, in part because of toxicities.",We analyzed scientific papers to measure the frequency and risk for alopecia in patients receiving hormonal therapies.
24037977,We performed a systematic analysis of the literature to ascertain the incidence and risk for alopecia in patients receiving endocrine therapies.,"Data from 19,430 patients in 35 clinical trials were available for analysis."

24037977,"The highest incidence of all-grade alopecia was observed in patients treated with tamoxifen in a phase II trial (25.4%); similarly, the overall incidence of grade 2 alopecia by meta-analysis was highest with tamoxifen (6.4%).",The highest frequency of any alopecia was seen in patients treated with tamoxifen (an estrogen-influencing drug) in a clinical trial (25.4%).
24037977,"The overall relative risk of alopecia in comparison with placebo was 12.88 (p < .001), with selective estrogen receptor modulators having the highest risk.","Similarly, the overall frequency of severe alopecia in the analysis was highest with tamoxifen (6.4%)."
24037977,Conclusion: Alopecia is a common yet underreported adverse event of endocrine-based cancer therapies.,"The overall risk of alopecia compared with sham treatment was 12.88, with specific estrogen-receptor influencers having the highest risk."
24037977,Their long-term use heightens the importance of this condition on patients' quality of life.,"In conclusion, alopecia is a common yet rarely-mentioned side effect of hormonal cancer therapies."

31728379,Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is among the most common elective procedures performed worldwide.,Knee replacement is one of the most common types of surgery that people choose to have worldwide.
31728379,"Recent efforts have been made to significantly improve patient outcomes, specifically with postoperative rehabilitation.","Recently, doctors have tried to make big improvements in outcomes, especially during the rehab process."
31728379,"Despite the many rehabilitation modalities available, the optimal rehabilitation strategy has yet to be determined.","Even though there are lots of ways to do rehab, doctors have not figured out the best strategy."
31728379,"Therefore, this systematic review focuses on evaluating existing postoperative rehabilitation protocols.","Because of this, we will focus on rating different rehab strategies that are in published papers."

30281207,PT records from the terminal episode of care were reviewed and utilization and exercise content data were extracted.,We also examined associations of specific details of PT after surgery with how much function patients had after 6 months.
30281207,Descriptive statistics and linear regression models characterized PT treatment factors and identified associations with 6-month outcomes.,We collected PT data from patients who were having knee replacement surgery on one side and participating in a clinical trial of a phone-based coaching program.
30281207,Results: We analyzed 112 records from 30 PT sites.,We reviewed PT records from final sessions to find how much patients used the PT and what exercises were done.
30281207,Content and dose of specific exercises and incidence of progression varied widely.,We used statistical methods to see which parts of PT treatment were associated with 6-month outcomes.
30281207,Open chain exercises were utilized more frequently than closed chain (median 21,"In all, we looked at 112 records from 30 PT sites."

30281207,[IQR 4-28.5]).,Exercises that used weights or other resistance were use more than body-weight exercises (on average 21 versus 13).
30281207,"Median (IQR) occurrence of progression of closed and open chain exercise was 0 (0-2) and 1 (0-3), respectively.",Progression of exercises was used on average 0 times for exercises with resistance and 1 time for exercises that just used body weight.
30281207,Shorter timed stair climb was associated with greater total number of PT interventions and use and progression of closed chain exercises.,Climbing stairs faster was associated with more PT sessions and the use and progression of body-weight exercises.
30281207,Discussion:,The evidence suggests that treatments backed by studies are not used as much as they should be and the amount of PT may not be enough to create the best possible outcomes.
31427131,Background: Early ambulation with physical therapy (PT) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has demonstrated benefits in the literature.,Research has shown that having patients walk early with physical therapy (PT) after knee replacement has benefits.

31427131,We evaluate the effect of same-day PT on inhospital functional outcomes and opioid consumption.,We looked at the effect of same-day PT on how well patients functions and opioid use while in the hospital.
31427131,"Methods: We retrospectively identified 2 cohorts of primary TKA patients from July 2016 to December 2017: PT0 (n = 295) received PT on the day of surgery, and PT1 (n = 392) received PT on postoperative day (POD) 1.","To do this, we looked at 2 past groups of knee replacement patients from July 2016 to December 2017."

31427131,Analysis was conducted using the Student t-test and Fisher exact test.,The second group had 392 patients and received PT on the day after surgery.
31427131,Results:,"The outcomes we looked at included the number of feet walked in the first 3 days after surgery, patient reported pain scores, amount of morphine or similar drugs used, length of stay, and where the patient was sent on discharge."
31427131,"In comparison to the PT1 group, the PT0 group walked significantly more steps on POD1 (347.6 vs 167.4 ft, P < .0001), POD2 (342.1 vs 203.5 ft, P < .0001), and POD3 (190.3 vs 128.9 ft, P = .00028).","In comparison to the second group (which had PT the day of after surgery), the first group (which had PT the day of the surgery) walked significantly more steps on the first 3 days after surgery."

24172642,"Given the potential positive influence of postoperative rehabilitation and the lack of established standards for prescribing exercise paradigms after TKA, the purpose of this study was to systematically review randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of postoperative outpatient care on short- and long-term functional recovery.","However, recovery varies, and most patients continue to have weakness in the legs and less function compared to peers of the same age."
24172642,Nineteen studies were identified as highly relevant for the review and four categories of postoperative intervention were discussed: 1) strengthening exercises; 2) aquatic therapy; 3) balance training; and 4) clinical environment.,There is a potential positive influence of rehab after surgery and a lack of established standards for prescribing exercise paradigms after knee replacement.
24172642,"Optimal outpatient physical therapy protocols should include: strengthening and intensive functional exercises given through land-based or aquatic programs, the intensity of which is increased based on patient progress.","With this in mind, our goal in this review article was to look carefully at studies to determine how effective outpatient care is for regaining function short-term and long-term."
24172642,"Due to the highly individualized characteristics of these types of exercises, outpatient physical therapy performed in a clinic under the supervision of a trained physical therapist may provide the best long-term outcomes after the surgery.",We found 19 studies that we deemed very relevant for the review.

28901118,The difference in muscle strength was maintained at 12-month follow-up.,"In conclusion, participants getting Maximal Strength Training (MST) had better increases in leg press and knee extension muscle strength compared to those who had standard rehab, as measured at 7-day to 10-week follow-ups after surgery."
28901118,No differences in functional performance were found at any time-point.,The difference in muscle strength was maintained at 12-month follow-up.
28901118,Clinical rehabilitation impact: Exercises after TKA should be performed with high intensity and target the operated leg specifically.,No differences in functional performance were found at any point.

17260529,"Results and conclusion: In fact, it has been proposed that suboptimal vitamin B6 status is associated with certain diseases that particularly afflict the elderly population: impaired cognitive function, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and different types of cancer.",This research was summarised and compared in different chapters.
17260529,"Some of these problems may be related to the elevated homocysteine concentrations associated to vitamin B6 deficiency, but there is also evidence for other mechanisms independent of homocysteine by which a suboptimal vitamin B6 status could increase the risk for these chronic diseases.","Researchers have proposed that less than adequate (suboptimal) vitamin B6 levels are associated with certain diseases that particularly trouble the elderly population such as: decreased ability to think clearly, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and different types of cancer."
11813080,"The vitamins folic acid, B12 and B6 and B2 are the source of coenzymes which participate in one carbon metabolism.","There are several B vitamins: folic acid, B12 and B6 and B2."
11813080,"In this metabolism, a carbon unit from serine or glycine is transferred to tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form methylene-THF.",They are important in one carbon metabolism of protein and DNA metabolism.
11813080,"This is either used as such for the synthesis of thymidine, which is incorporated into DNA, oxidized to formyl-THF which is used for the synthesis of purines, which are building blocks of RNA and DNA, or it is reduced to methyl-THF which used to methylate homocysteine to form methionine, a reaction which is catalyzed by a B12-containing methyltransferase.","Here, one carbon unit is transferred from an amino acid (building blocks of proteins) by a B vitamin, tetrahydrofolate (THF), to form a new chemical, methylene-THF."
11813080,"Much of the methionine which is formed is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal donor of methyl groups, including DNA, RNA, hormones, neurotransmitters, membrane lipids, proteins and others.","Methylene-THF is used in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, or in the metabolism of important amino acids (such as the reaction that changes one amino acid, homocysteine, to another amino acid, methionine)."
11813080,"Because of these functions, interest in recent years has been growing particularly in the area of aging and the possibility that certain diseases that afflict the aging population, loss of cognitive function, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and others, may be in part explained by inadequate intake or inadequate status of these vitamins.","Much of the methionine which is formed is made into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and then used in the metabolism of DNA, RNA, hormones, neurotransmitters (nerve impulse chemicals), cell lipids (fats), proteins and others."

11813080,These associations could be due to a neurotoxic effect of homocysteine or to decreased availability of SAM which results in hypomethylation in the brain tissue.,"Homocysteine, an amino acid that is both needed to make methionine as well as made from methionine metabolism was shown recently to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke and blood clots when its amount in blood is slightly elevated."
11813080,"Hypomethylation is also thought to exacerbate depressive tendency in people, and for (colorectal) cancer DNA hypomethylation is thought to be the link between the observed relationship between inadequate folate status and cancer.",Facts now show association between increased blood levels of homocysteine and loss of brain function and Alzheimer's disease.
11813080,There are many factors that contribute to the fact that the status of these vitamins in the elderly is inadequate.,These associations could be due to harmful effects of homocysteine on the nervous system or on the decreased amount of SAM in the brain.
11813080,These factors are in part physiological such as the achlorhydria which affects vitamin B12 absorption and in part socioeconomic and habitual.,Problems with methionine metabolism are also thought to increase depressive tendency in people.
11813080,We need more studies to confirm that these vitamins have important functions in the etiology of these diseases.,These problems with methionine and DNA metabolism are also thought to be the link between the relationship seen between low levels of vitamin B folate and colorectal cancer.

33941768,We have reported that a subpopulation of patients with schizophrenia have lower levels of vitamin B6 (VB6) in peripheral blood than do healthy controls.,Research has shown that some patients with schizophrenia have lower levels of vitamin B6 in the blood than healthy people.
33941768,"In a previous study, we found that VB6 level was inversely proportional to the patient's positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) score for measuring symptom severity, suggesting that the loss of VB6 might contribute to the development of schizophrenia symptoms.",A study showed that lower vitamin B6 levels increased symptoms of schizophrenia.

33941768,"After feeding for 4 weeks, plasma VB6 level in VB6(-) mice decreased to 3% of that in control mice.","To study the relationship between vitamin B6 and schizophrenia, research was done on mice fed a diet without vitamin B6 ."
33941768,The VB6(-) mice showed social deficits and cognitive impairment.,This made a mouse model of vitamin B6 deficiency.
33941768,"Furthermore, the VB6(-) mice showed a marked increase in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in the brain, suggesting enhanced noradrenaline (NA) metabolism in VB6(-) mice.","After 4 weeks of that diet, blood levels of vitamin B6 in these mice decreased to 3% of the healthy mice."

23334322,"Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), the bioactive form of vitamin B6, reportedly functions as a prosthetic group for >4% of classified enzymatic activities of the cell.",Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6 in the body.
23334322,It is therefore not surprising that alterations of vitamin B6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases.,PLP is involved in more than 4% of the chemical reactions of proteins in the cell.

23334322,"In addition, PLP is required for the catabolism of homocysteine by transsulfuration.","For example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, a protein that appeared early in evolution, result in seizures."
23334322,"Hence, reduced circulating levels of B6 vitamers (including PLP as well as its major precursor pyridoxine) are frequently paralleled by hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition that has been associated with an increased risk for multiple cardiovascular diseases.",These seizures are due to an increase in a chemical (made during vitamin B6 metabolism) that stops the function of PLP.
23334322,"During the past 30 years, an intense wave of clinical investigation has attempted to dissect the putative links between vitamin B6 and cancer.",PLP is also required for the metabolism of homocysteine (an amino acid involved in vitamin B metabolism)..
23334322,"Thus, high circulating levels of vitamin B6, as such or as they reflected reduced amounts of circulating homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients bearing a wide range of hematological and solid neoplasms.",Lower blood levels of B6 vitamers (active vitamin B6 chemicals-PLP and pyridoxine) are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (excess blood homocysteine).
23334322,"More recently, the proficiency of vitamin B6 metabolism has been shown to modulate the adaptive response of tumor cells to a plethora of physical and chemical stress conditions.",Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a higher risk of many cardiovascular diseases.
23334322,"Moreover, elevated levels of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the enzyme that converts pyridoxine and other vitamin B6 precursors into PLP, have been shown to constitute a good, therapy-independent prognostic marker in patients affected by non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).","During the past 30 years, a lot of research has tried to explain links between vitamin B6 and cancer."
23334322,"Here, we will discuss the clinical relevance of vitamin B6 metabolism as a prognostic factor in cancer patients.","High blood levels of vitamin B6, or the related lower blood levels of homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients with blood and solid organ neoplasms."

34578855,A higher log-transformed PLP was not significantly associated with a lower risk for cancer mortality.,Participants with higher blood vitamin B6 had a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 19% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality for each unit level of PLP (using the Cox model).
34578855,"Compared with sufficient vitamin B6, deficient (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.60) and insufficient (HR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.02, 1.38) vitamin B6 level were significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality.",Higher PLP blood levels were not significantly associated with a lower risk of cancer mortality (using the Cox model).
34578855,There was no significant association for cause-specific mortality.,"Compared with sufficient vitamin B6 levels, deficient and insufficient vitamin B6 levels were significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality (Cox model)."
34578855,Participants with higher levels of vitamin B6 had a lower risk for all-cause mortality.,There was no significant association for cause-specific mortality.

24996539,"Outcomes collected were post-operative pain at rest and during activity after 24 and 48 hours, opioid requirement, mobilisation, hospital stay and complications.","In 13 studies including 909 patients having THR, patients that got local anaesthetic had a bigger reduction in pain at 24 hours at rest and at 48 hours during activity."
24996539,"When feasible, we estimated pooled treatment effects using random effects meta-analyses.","In TKR, various regimens using multiple types of anesthesia were reported."
24996539,Results:,"In 23 studies including 1439 patients having TKR, using local anaesthetic reduced pain at 24 hours at rest and at 48 hours during activity, compared with patients receiving no local anesthetic, or placebo (sham treatment so patients were not biased)."
24996539,"In 13 studies including 909 patients undergoing THR, patients receiving local anaesthetic infiltration experienced a greater reduction in pain at 24 hours at rest by standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.61 (95% CI -1.05, -0.16; p = 0.008) and by SMD -0.43 (95% CI -0.78 -0.09; p = 0.014) at 48 hours during activity.","In studies where more local anaesthetic was used after closing the wound, there was evidence of a bigger reduction."
24996539,"In TKR, diverse multi-modal regimens were reported.","There was no evidence of pain control on top of what was provided by femoral nerve block, a type of local anesthetic applied directly to a large nerve in the thigh."
24996539,"In 23 studies including 1439 patients undergoing TKR, local anaesthetic infiltration reduced pain on average by SMD -0.40 (95% CI -0.58, -0.22; p < 0.001) at 24 hours at rest and by SMD -0.27 (95% CI -0.50, -0.05; p = 0.018) at 48 hours during activity, compared with patients receiving no infiltration or placebo.","Patients that got local anaesthetic spent, on average, an estimated 0.83 fewer days in hospital after THR and 0.87 fewer days in hospital after TKR."
24996539,There was evidence of a larger reduction in studies delivering additional local anaesthetic after wound closure.,"They also had took fewer opioids, walked earlier, and vomited less."
24996539,There was no evidence of pain control additional to that provided by femoral nerve block.,Not many studies reported long-term outcomes.
24996539,"Patients receiving local anaesthetic infiltration spent on average an estimated 0.83 (95% CI 1.54, 0.12; p = 0.022) and 0.87 (95% CI 1.62, 0.11; p = 0.025) fewer days in hospital after THR and TKR respectively, had reduced opioid consumption, earlier mobilisation, and lower incidence of vomiting.",Our first conclusion is that local anaesthesia is effective in reducing short-term pain and hospital stay in patients having THR and TKR.
24996539,Few studies reported long-term outcomes.,"Second, studies should assess whether local anaesthesia can prevent long-term pain."
24996539,Conclusions: Local anaesthetic infiltration is effective in reducing short-term pain and hospital stay in patients receiving THR and TKR.,"Finally, enhanced pain control with additional medicine through a catheter should be weighed against a possible infection risk."
31957218,Background: We implemented local infiltration analgesia (LIA) as a technique of providing post-operative pain management and early mobilization after arthroplasty surgery and have progressively found patients able to go home earlier.,Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) a method for managing pain and encouraging walking early after joint surgery.
31957218,This study compares the national data on hip and knee arthroplasty provided by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Medibank Private with our outcomes using LIA and rapid recovery.,It involves injecting several painkillers directly into the surgical wound during and after the procedure.
31957218,"Methods: Prospective study of one surgeon including 200 knees, and 165 hips in the two years till June 2016.",We applied LIA and have found more and more that patients are able to go home earlier.
31957218,"Variables included in comparison to the two groups were: length of stay, percentage of patients transferred to rehabilitation or intensive care unit (ICU), readmitted within 30 days and average separation cost.",This study uses national data on hip and knee surgery provided by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Medibank Private.
31957218,Results:,It compares the national data with our outcomes using LIA and rapid recovery.
31957218,"Hip replacement median length of stay in our series was two nights versus five nights, inpatient rehabilitation 7% versus 36%, ICU admission zero versus 4%, and readmissions 3.9% versus 6.0%, the average hospital separation cost in our series was $17 813 versus $26 734.",This study followed patients over time and was done by one surgeon.

30066029,Introduction:,Options for managing pain after surgery are very important for patients having a hip replacement.
30066029,"Postoperative pain management options are of great importance for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, as joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures.",This is because joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures.
30066029,This study demonstrates pain outcome until 4 weeks postoperatively and evaluates factors influencing pain in the postoperative course after total hip arthroplasty.,This study shows pain outcome until 4 weeks after surgery and evaluates factors that influence pain during followup after a hip replacement.
30066029,Materials and methods: A total of 103 patients were included in this prospective cohort trial and underwent total hip arthroplasty.,This was a study that followed a group of patients over time.
30066029,Postoperative pain was described using a numerical rating scale (NRS); demographic data and perioperative parameters were correlated with postoperative pain.,It included a total of 103 patients that had a hip replacement.
30066029,"Results: Evaluation of pain scores in the postoperative course showed a constant decrease in the first postoperative week (mean NRS 3.1 on day 1 to mean NRS 2.3 on day 8) and, then, a perpetual increase for 3 days (mean NRS 2.6 on day 9 to mean NRS 2.3 on day 12).",Pain following surgery was described using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).
30066029,"Afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean NRS 0.9 on day 29).",Demographic information and ways in which the surgery was done were correlated with the amount of pain after surgery.
30066029,"No correlation was found between the potential influencing factors sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, ASA score, and postoperative pain levels, but a high significant correlation could be stated for preoperative pain levels and postoperative pain intensity (pain while moving p < 0.02 to p < 0.05 depending on the time period ""week 1 postoperatively"", ""week 2-4"", or ""week 1-4""; pain while resting p < 0.001, in all the measured time intervals, respectively).",Looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week after surgery (average NRS 3.1 on day 1 to average NRS 2.3 on day 8).
30066029,"Conclusion: Increasing pain levels after the first week postoperatively, for 3 days, are most likely to be caused by the change to more extensive mobilization and physiotherapy in the rehabilitation unit.","After that, there was a continuous increase for 3 days (average NRS 2.6 on day 9 to average NRS 2.3 on day 12)."
30066029,No significant influence or correlation on the intensity of postoperative pain could be found while evaluating potential predictors except preoperative pain levels.,"Afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean NRS 0.9 on day 29)."
30066029,Pain management has to take these findings into account in the future to further increase patients' satisfaction in the postoperative course after total hip arthroplasty and to adapt pain management programs.,"No correlation was found between the potential factors of sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, ASA score (used to measure fitness for surgery), and pain levels following the operation."
33709165,Introduction: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures.,"Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA, or hip replacement) is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures."
33709165,Perioperative management and rehabilitation patterns are of great importance for the success of the procedure.,How the patient is cared for and rehabilitated around the time of surgery are very important for the success of the procedure.
33709165,"The aim of this cohort study was the evaluation of function, mobilization and pain scores during the inpatient stay (6 days postoperatively) and 4 weeks after fast-track THA.",This was a study of a group of patients that all had fast-track THA.
33709165,Materials and methods: A total of 102 consecutive patients were included in this retrospective cohort trial after minimally invasive cementless total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia in a fast-track setup.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate function, ability to walk, and pain scores during the inpatient stay (6 days following surgery) and 4 weeks after the procedure."
33709165,The extent of mobilization under full-weight-bearing with crutches (walking distance in meters and necessity of nurse aid) and pain values using a numerical rating scale (NRS) were measured.,"To perform the study, we included a total of 102 consecutive patients that had previously had minimally invasive cementless THA under spinal anesthesia in a fast-track setup."
33709165,"Function was evaluated measuring the range of motion (ROM) and the ability of sitting on a chair, walking and personal hygiene.","We measured how far patients could walk under their full weight with crutches, and how much a nurse had to help."
33709165,"Furthermore, circumferences of thighs were measured to evaluate the extent of postoperative swelling.",We also measured pain using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).
33709165,The widespread Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to compare results pre- and 4 weeks postoperatively.,"We looked at function as measured by the range of motion (ROM) and the ability to sit on a chair, to walk and to maintain personal hygiene."
33709165,Results: Evaluation of pain scores in the postoperative course showed a constant decrease in the first postoperative week (days 1-6 postoperatively).,"On top of that, we measured circumferences of patients?? thighs to look at how much swelling there was after surgery."
33709165,"The pain scores before surgery were significantly higher than surgery (day 6), during mobilization (p < 0.001), at rest (p < 0.001) and at night (p < 0.001).",We used the widely used Harris Hip Score (HHS) to compare results before surgery and 4 weeks after surgery.
33709165,All patients were able to mobilize on the day of surgery.,Looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week (days 1-6 after surgery).
33709165,"In addition, there was a significant improvement in independent activities within the first 6 days postoperatively: sitting on a chair (p < 0.001), walking (p < 0.001) and personal hygiene (p < 0.001).","The pain scores before surgery were significantly higher than day 6 after surgery, when attempting to walk, at rest, and at night."
33709165,There was no significant difference between the measured preoperative and postoperative (day 6 after surgery) thigh circumferences above the knee joint.,All patients were able to walk on the day of surgery.
33709165,"Compared to preoperatively, there was a significant (p < 0.001) improvement of the HHS 4 weeks after surgery.","In addition, there was a significant improvement in independent activities within the first 6 days following surgery."
33709165,"In 100% of the cases, the operation was reported to be successful and all of the treated patients would choose a fast-track setup again.","These activities were sitting on a chair, walking and personal hygiene."
33709165,Conclusion: Application of a fast-track scheme is effective regarding function and mobilization of patients.,"There was no significant difference between the thigh circumferences above the knee joint, measured before surgery and on day 6 after surgery."
33709165,Low pain values and rapid improvement of walking distance confirms the success of the fast-track concept in the immediate postoperative course.,"Compared to before surgery, there was a significant improvement of the HHS 4 weeks after surgery."
33709165,Future prospective studies have to confirm the results comparing a conventional and a fast-track pathway.,"In 100% of the cases, the operation was reported to be successful and all of the treated patients would choose a fast-track setup again."
28870302,"Total hip and knee arthroplasty is associated with significant perioperative pain, which can adversely affect recovery by increasing risk of complications, length of stay, and cost.",Hip and knee replacement surgery is associated with significant pain around the time of the procedure.
28870302,"Historically, opioids were the mainstay of perioperative pain control.","This can make recovery worse by increasing the risk of additional problems, length of stay, and cost."
28870302,"However, opioids are associated with significant downsides.","Historically, opioids were the main way to control pain around the time of surgery."
28870302,Preemptive use of a multimodal pain management approach has become the standard of care to manage pain after hip and knee arthroplasty.,"However, opioids are associated with significant downsides."
28870302,"Multimodal pain management uses oral medicines, peripheral nerve blocks, intra-articular injections, and other tools to reduce the need for opioids.",Using several pain treatments at once (called multimodal pain management) before pain starts has become the standard way to manage pain after hip and knee replacement.
28870302,"Use of a multimodal approach promises to decrease complications, improve outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction after hip and knee arthroplasty.","Multimodal pain management uses drugs taken by mouth, injections into nerves, injections into joints, and other tools to reduce the need for opioids."
31352132,"Background: Pain management after total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty is pivotal, as it determines the outcome of the recovery process after surgery.",Taking care of pain after knee replacement and and hip replacement is critical because it determines the how the patient recovers after surgery.
31352132,Ineffective pain control results in many postoperative complications and hinders successful recovery.,Ways of controlling pain that are not effective causes many additional problems after surgery and hinders successful recovery.
31352132,"In recent years, the transition from opioids to a multimodal pain management approach after total knee and total hip arthroplasty has increasingly become an alternative.","In recent years, changing from opioids after knee and hip replacement to using multiple pain medicines at once has increasingly become an alternative."
31352132,This is due to the multitude of adverse effects associated with opioids.,This is because of the many side effects of opioids.
31352132,"As a result, the use of non-opioid interventions such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and ketamine, and techniques such as peripheral nerve block and local infiltration analgesia have become more favorable.","As a result, the use of non-opioid treatments and techniques such as peripheral nerve block, which directly numbs a large nerve, and local anesthetic have become more favorable."
31352132,Objectives:,"Non-opioid treatments include acetaminophen (Tylenol??), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, gabapentinoids (such as Lyrica or Neurontin), and ketamine."
31352132,This paper aims to summarize literature around the effectiveness of non-opioid interventions as part of a multimodal pain management after total knee and total hip arthroplasty.,This paper aims to summarize literature about the effectiveness of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain management plan after knee and hip replacement.
31352132,Methods: A literature review was conducted to provide evidence-based information with respect to pain management during the postoperative period in order to enhance the pain recovery process.,We reviewed the scientific research on pain management to improve recovery following surgery.
31352132,"The literature chosen was extracted through the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase.",We did this to provide evidence-based information with respect to this pain management.
31352132,Twenty-seven eligible articles were identified that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.,The scientific papers we chose were taken from several electronic databases.
31352132,"Results: Literary evidence shows that non-opioid interventions such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, ketamine, peripheral nerve blocks, and local infiltration analgesia benefit patients after total knee and total hip arthroplasty for pain management.",We found 27 articles that met our standards for being included in this review.
31352132,"However, further quality research trials are necessary for more conclusive evidence-based information.","Evidence in scientific literature shows that non-opioid pain treatments such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, ketamine, peripheral nerve blocks, and local anesthesia benefit patients after knee and hip replacement."
31352132,Conclusion: Selective literature supports the use of non-opioid interventions as part of a multimodal analgesics regimen for effective pain management after total knee and total hip arthroplasty.,"However, further quality research trials are needed to be more sure."
34232932,Multimodal analgesia has become the standard of care for total joint arthroplasty as it provides superior analgesia with fewer side effects than opioid-only protocols.,Using several types of pain treatment at once has become the standard way to care for patients having joint replacement surgery.
34232932,"Systemic medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids, and local anesthetics via local infiltration analgesia and peripheral nerve blocks, are the foundation of multimodal analgesia in total joint arthroplasty.",This is because this approach reduces pain better with fewer side effects than only using opioids.
34232932,"Ideally, multimodal analgesia should begin preoperatively and continue throughout the perioperative period and beyond discharge.","Some pain medicines affect the whole body, including NSAIDs, Tylenol??, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids (such as Lyrica or Neurontin)."
34232932,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of intravenous acetaminophen or liposomal bupivacaine as part of multimodal analgesia protocols.,"These medicines, local anesthetics, and peripheral nerve blocks, are the foundation of the multi-pronged approach for joint replacement surgery."
33204789,Background: Opioid addiction is endemic in the United States.,Opioid addiction is commonplace in the United States.
33204789,We developed a standardized opioid-prescribing schedule (SOPS) after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and evaluated opioid usage alongside Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference scores.,We created a standard for prescribing opioids to treat pain after hip and knee replacement.
33204789,We hypothesized that opioid usage would be less than prescribed and reducing prescription would decrease consumption without negatively impacting the PROMIS scores.,We also studied opioid usage alongside a system of measuring pain as reported by patients.
33204789,"Methods: A prospective observational study was performed on all patients undergoing primary THA and TKA from April 7, 2018, to August 10, 2019.",We assumed that people would use opioids less than prescribed.
33204789,Opioid consumption and pain interference were determined 2 weeks after discharge via telephone and email surveys.,We also assumed that reducing prescriptions of opioids would reduce the amount taken without increasing the amount of pain reported.
33204789,SOPSs were implemented during the study.,"This study followed patients over time, without intervening."
33204789,Outcomes were compared in patients before and after the SOPS.,"It was done on all patients that had hip and knee replacement from April 7, 2018, to August 10, 2019."
33204789,Results:,We determined the amount of opioids used and how pain interfered with patients?? lives 2 weeks after discharge using telephone and email surveys.
33204789,A total of 715 patients met inclusion criteria; 201 patients completed surveys.,Standards for prescribing opioids were used during the study.
33204789,"Before the SOPS, the mean opioid prescription was 81.2 ?? 15.3 tablets for THA and 82.9 ?? 10.6 for TKA.",Outcomes were compared in patients before and after following these standards.
33204789,"The mean usage was 35.1 ?? 29.4 tablets and 35.4 ?? 33.4, respectively.",A total of 715 patients were able to be in the study.
33204789,"After the SOPS, the mean usage decreased to 19.4 ?? 16.8 (P = .04) and 31.6 ?? 20.9 (P = .52), respectively.","Of those, 201 patients completed surveys."
33204789,"After implementation of a second SOPS for THA, the mean number of tablets consumed was 21.5 ?? 18.6 (P = .05 compared with pre-SOPS).","Before the standards were followed, the average opioid prescription was about 81 tablets for hip replacement and about 83 tablets for knee replacement."
33204789,The PROMIS 6B responses in patients who underwent THA demonstrated no significant changes.,The average number of tablets used for both hip replacement and knee replacement was 35.
33204789,"PROMIS 6B responses for TKA showed an increase in interference with recreational activities (P = .04) and tasks away from home (P = .04), but otherwise had no significant impact on reported scores.","After the standards were followed, the average number of tables taken dropped to about 19 for hip replacement and about 32 for knee replacement."
33204789,"Conclusions: Implementation of the SOPS reduced postoperative opioid prescription and consumption without significantly impacting the reported pain interference, supporting the need to decrease opioid prescription after THA and TKA.","After following a second standard for hip replacement, the average number of tablets taken was about 22."
30562208,"There are multiple available agents and modalities for controlling pain perioperatively during total joint arthroplasty to improve the patient experience, and their unique mechanisms and applications should be considered for use preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively, keeping in mind that each has differing efficacy and side-effect profiles.",There are many options to control pain during joint replacement surgery to improve the patient experience.
30562208,"Preoperative pain control or preemptive analgesia using anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics appears to be effective in reducing postoperative pain, although the recommended timing and type of agents are unclear.","Doctors should consider the unique ways that each of these options works when using them before, during, and after surgery."
30562208,"With regard to intraoperative anesthetic choice and pain control, spinal anesthesia appears to have fewer systemic risks than general anesthesia, and periarticular injections of local anesthetic agents, regardless of technique, and with or without the addition of sympathetic modulators, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids, have been shown to improve pain scores postoperatively and to overall carry a low risk profile.",Doctors should also keep in mind that each has different efficacy and side-effects.
30562208,"When considering postoperative pain control, there are several modalities including cryotherapy, peripheral nerve blockade, and parenteral and enteral medication options including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, neuromodulators, tramadol, ketamine, and opioid patches, but there is no clearly preferred medication regimen and individual patient risk profiles must be considered when choosing appropriate pain management agents.",Pain control before surgery or using anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid painkillers before the pain starts seems to work well to reduce pain after surgery.
30562208,"Multimodal pain management can decrease opioid usage, improve pain scores, increase patient satisfaction, and enhance early recovery.","However, it is not clear what the recommended timing and type of treatment are."
30562208,"The ideal preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative pain medication regimen remains unclear, and an individualized approach to perioperative pain management is recommended.","Regarding the choice of anesthetic during surgery and pain control, anesthesia applied directly to the spine seems to have fewer general risks to the body than general anesthesia."
30562208,"Despite this, good results are demonstrated with the existing variations in pain management protocols in the literature.","In addition, injections of local anesthetics around the joint, regardless of technique, have been shown to improve pain scores following surgery and to have low risk overall."
30562208,"Treatment of severe postoperative pain in a multimodal fashion carries the risk for serious side effects, including respiratory depression, mental status changes influencing safe gait mechanics, hypotension, renal and hepatic dysfunction, hematologic variations, gastrointestinal considerations including gastric ulcers, constipation or ileus, nausea or vomiting, infection at injection sites, and peripheral nerve injury with peripheral blockade.","This is true whether the injections are used with or without adding other drugs, including those that control the body??s fight-or-flight response, opioids, NSAIDs or corticosteroids."

15895778,"They had been identified as having sudden-onset cough, laryngospasm, or throat-clearing after viral illness, surgery, or an unknown trigger.",This sensory neuropathy involved the superior or recurrent laryngeal nerves.
15895778,Cough and laryngospasm were the most common complaints.,"These patients had sudden-onset cough, muscle spasm of the voice box (laryngospasm), or throat-clearing after viral illness, surgery, or due to an unknown reason."
15895778,Seventy-one percent of the patients had concomitant superior laryngeal nerve or recurrent laryngeal nerve motor neuropathy documented by laryngeal electromyography or videostroboscopy.,Cough and laryngospasm were the most common complaints.
15895778,"After a negative workup for reflux, asthma, or postnasal drip, these patients were treated with gabapentin at 100 to 900 mg/d. Symptomatic relief was achieved in 68% of the patients.",71% of the patients also had motor neuropathy (nerve damage to the nerves that control the muscles) of the throat.
15895778,Sensory neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve or superior laryngeal nerve should be considered in the workup for chronic cough or larynx irritability.,This damage was shown by special tests that measure the function of the larynx and vocal cords.
15895778,Symptomatic management of patients with cough and laryngospasm due to a suspected sensory neuropathy may include the use of antiseizure medications such as gabapentin.,"The patients were treated with the drug, gabapentin (a drug used to treat seizures), if the workup did not show reflux, asthma, or postnasal drip."
20392032,Objectives: We identify management strategies for the treatment of upper respiratory tract symptoms stemming from dysfunction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.,Researchers studied ways to treat patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms due to disorder of a nerve supplying sensation (sensory neuropathy) to the throat-the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
20392032,"Methods: We present a retrospective case series of patients who had symptoms of sensory neuropathy, including persistent dysphonia, laryngospasm, and chronic cough.","Researchers studied patients who had symptoms of sensory neuropathy including disorders of speech (dysphonia), spasms of the muscles of the voice box (laryngospasm), and chronic cough."
20392032,The patients were followed for symptomatic improvement after initiation of treatment with a neuromodulator.,The patients were followed to see if their symptoms improved after starting a neuromodulator (a drug that has an effect on nerves).
20392032,Treatment outcome was defined by improvement or resolution of symptoms on a self-reported outcome scale.,Patients were asked if the drug improved their symptoms.
20392032,"Results: Of 12 patients identified, 75% exhibited evidence of motor neuropathy on laryngoscopy and 83% had symptoms related to chronic cough treated with neuromodulator therapy over a mean follow-up of 20.4 months.","In 12 patients, tests showed 75% had motor neuropathy (disorder of the nerves controlling the muscles) of the throat."
20392032,"The median dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride was 25 mg daily, and that of gabapentin was 300 mg 3 times daily.","Also, 83% had chronic cough treated with a neuromodulator."
20392032,The mean time from the initiation of therapy to a complete response was 2 months.,They were followed for about 20 months.
20392032,Conclusions: Patients with suspected neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve frequently respond to neuromodulator therapy.,"Two neuromodulator drugs were used in the study, amitriptyline hydrochloride (about 25 mg a day) and gabapentin (about 300 mg three times a day)."
20392032,The addition of reflux precautions and acid suppression therapy is helpful in cases of chronic and recurrent laryngospasm.,It took about 2 months for complete symptom improvement after the drugs were first started.
20392032,Patients with evidence of motor neuropathy appear to have better outcomes with neuromodulator therapy.,These neuromodulator drugs often help the symptoms if doctors suspect neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as the cause.

16995969,"Currently, there is no recognized treatment which is effective against these troublesome symptoms.",But in many cases the cause is not found.
16995969,This observational study investigated the effectiveness of a regime of sipping ice cold carbonated water to try to break the vicious cycle of throat clearing.,"Currently, there is no accepted treatment which is effective against these symptoms."

33072979,Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenetic disorder due to a single base-pair point mutation in the ??-globin gene resulting in the substitution of the amino acid valine for glutamic acid in the ??-globin chain.,Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder due to a single mutation in the Beta-globin gene.
33072979,Phenotypic variation in the clinical presentation and disease outcome is a characteristic feature of the disorder.,This mutation causes a change in an amino acid in the Beta-hemoglobin protein that decreases the ability of oxygen to be carried out to the body.
33072979,Understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder is central to the choice of therapeutic development and intervention.,"Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) may experience a variety of signs, symptoms and disease outcomes from this disorder."
33072979,"In this special edition for newborn screening for haemoglobin disorders, it is pertinent to describe the genetic, pathologic and clinical presentation of sickle cell disease as a prelude to the justification for screening.","Understanding the causes, progression, and functional problems that result in patients with SCD are very important in finding and choosing treatments."
33072979,"Through a systematic review of the literature using search terms relating to SCD up till 2019, we identified relevant descriptive publications for inclusion.","In this special paper, doctors discuss the importance of screening newborns for SCD."
33072979,"The scope of this review is mainly an overview of the clinical features of pain, the cardinal symptom in SCD, which present following the drop in foetal haemoglobin as young as five to six months after birth.","They also describe the genes, the pathology, and the signs and symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease."
33072979,"The relative impact of haemolysis and small-vessel occlusive pathology remains controversial, a combination of features probably contribute to the different pathologies.",This paper is the result of a very thorough research of the literature on SCD.
33072979,We also provide an overview of emerging therapies in SCD.,The paper focuses on the pain SCD can cause after the decrease in fetal hemoglobin which occurs in infants as young as five to six months after birth.
18695233,Sickle cell disease (SCD) was the first human monogenic disorder to be characterized at the molecular level.,Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) was the first human genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a single gene to be described at the chemical level.
18695233,It results from the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 6 of the ??-chain of hemoglobin.,"SCD occurs when a mutation of the Beta-hemoglobin gene causes the amino acid, glutamic acid, to be replaced by valine in the beta chain of the hemoglobin protein."
18695233,The clinical manifestations of SCD arise from the tendency of sickle hemoglobin (known as HbS or ??2??S2) to polymerize at reduced oxygen tensions and deform red cells into the characteristic rigid sickle cell shape.,The signs and symptoms in SCD occur because these sickle hemoglobin (HbS) proteins tend to join together where oxygen levels are lower in the body.
18695233,"Such inflexible red cells cannot pass through the microcirculation efficiently, and this results in anemia (due to destruction of the red cells) and intermittent vasoocclusion causing tissue damage and pain.",This causes the red blood cells to change into the typical abnormal rigid sickle cell shape.
18695233,"Although all patients with homozygous SCD have exactly the same molecular defect, there is considerable clinical variation, ranging from death in early childhood to a normal life span with few complications.",These rigid red blood cells cannot pass through the smallest blood vessels well.
18695233,"Genetic modifiers of SCD include ??-thalassemia, and it has been known for many years that patients with increased levels of fetal Hb (HbF or ??2??2) often tend to have a relatively mild clinical course because HbF reduces the tendency of HbS to polymerise within the red cell.","This causes the vessels to be blocked, resulting in tissue damage and pain."
18695233,"Increased HbF may result from rare deletions within the ??-globin gene cluster or from point mutations in the promoters of the fetal ??-globin genes (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, HPFH), but additional loci are known to increase HbF levels in adult life.","These sickle red blood cells are also destroyed, which causes anemia."
18695233,"Identifying such loci has been a painstaking task, but a combination of genome-wide analysis within a large kindred and within twin pairs has identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major influences on fetal hemoglobin levels in adults.","Patients with the same genetic defect in SCD can have many different outcomes, ranging from death in early childhood to a normal life span with few problems."
18695233,A significant proportion of the variation in HbF levels and the frequency of painful crises in patients with SCD is accounted for by five common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these loci.,Alpha-Thalassemia is a genetic disease that can change the outcome of patients with SCD.
18667698,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating monogenic blood disorder with a highly variable phenotype characterized by severe pain crises, acute clinical events, and early mortality.",Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a disabling genetic blood disorder caused by a single mutation.
18667698,Interindividual variation in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a known and potentially heritable modifier of SCD severity.,"SCD can have various outcomes,but it can result in severe pain crises, acute symptoms, and early death."
18667698,High HbF levels are correlated with reduced morbidity and mortality.,The severity of the problems that occur in SCD can vary depending on the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the blood.
18667698,Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB loci have been implicated previously in HbF level variation in nonanemic European populations.,High HbF levels are associated with decreased problems and death in patients with SCD.
18667698,"We recently demonstrated an association between a BCL11A SNP and HbF levels in one SCD cohort [Uda M, et al. (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:1620-1625].","Common single mutations in two genes, BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB, are thought to cause the changes in HbF levels seen in European populations without anemia."
18667698,"Here, we genotyped additional BCL11A SNPs, HBS1L-MYB SNPs, and an SNP upstream of (G)gamma-globin (HBG2; the XmnI polymorphism), in two independent SCD cohorts: the African American Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) and an SCD cohort from Brazil.",Research has shown a connection between a single BCL11A gene mutation and HbF levels in some SCD patients.
18667698,We studied the effect of these SNPs on HbF levels and on a measure of SCD-related morbidity (pain crisis rate).,"In this paper, researchers found more single mutations in the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and HBC2 genes in two other groups of patients (a study in African Americans SCD patients and a study of SCD patients from Brazil)."
18667698,"We strongly replicated the association between these SNPs and HbF level variation (in the CSSCD, P values range from 0.04 to 2 x 10(-42)).",We studied the effect of these single gene mutations on HbF levels and the number of pain crises in SCD.
18667698,"Together, common SNPs at the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and beta-globin (HBB) loci account for >20% of the variation in HbF levels in SCD patients.",We showed a strong connection between the single mutations in these genes and different HbF levels.
18667698,We also have shown that HbF-associated SNPs associate with pain crisis rate in SCD patients.,"Common single mutations in the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, beta-globin (HBB) genes explain >20% of the different HbF levels in SCD patients."
18667698,These results provide a clear example of inherited common sequence variants modifying the severity of a monogenic disease.,"These mutations, associated with HbF levels, are also associated with the number of pain crises in SCD patients."
33216016,Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a disease characterized by abnormal red blood cell rheology.,Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disease that causes abnormal red blood cell flow through blood vessels.
33216016,"Because of their effects on HbS polymerization and red blood cell deformability, alpha-thalassemia and the residual HbF level are known genetic modifiers of the disease.","Due to their effects on sickle hemoglobin (HbS) chemistry and red blood cell shape changes, alpha-thalassemia (another genetic blood disease)and HbF (fetal hemoglobin) levels are known to change the course of SCA."
33216016,The aim of our study was to determine if the number of HbF quantitative trait loci (QTL) would also favor a specific sub-phenotype of SCA as it is the case for alpha-thalassemia.,"The aim of our study was to find out if the number of HbF-QTL, quantitative trait loci (QTL-special sections of DNA) would influence the severity of SCA as seen in alpha-thalassemia."
33216016,Our results confirmed that alpha-thalassemia protected from cerebral vasculopathy but increased the risk for frequent painful vaso-occlusive crises.,Results showed that alpha-thalassemia protected SCA patients from cerebral vasculopathy (diseases of blood vessels in the brain).
33216016,We also showed that more HbF-QTL may provide an additional and specific protection against cerebral vasculopathy but only for children with alpha-thalassemia (-??/???? or -??/-?? genotypes).,"But, it increased the risk for more painful crises due to blood vessel blockages."
32772141,Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disease characterized by multisystem morbidity and highly variable clinical course.,Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disease that can affect many areas of the body.
32772141,Inter-individual variability in hemoglobin F (HbF) levels is one of the main modifiers that account for the clinical heterogeneity in SCD.,The course of the disease can vary between patients.
32772141,"HbF levels are affected by, among other factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the BCL11A gene and the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region and Xmn1 gene.",Different levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a main reason that explains the variation in the course of SCD.

31322815,Background: Our objective was to investigate the combined and differential effects of alpha-thalassemia -3.7 kb deletion and HbF-promoting quantitative trait loci (HbF-QTL) in Senegalese hydroxyurea (HU)-free children and young adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA).,"Researchers analyzed the effects of an alpha-thalassemia (another genetic blood disease) mutation and fetal hemoglobin-promoting quantitative trait loci (HbF-QTL (special section of DNA)) in Senegalese children and young adults with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) who have not received the medicine, hydroxyurea."
31322815,Procedure: Steady-state biological parameters and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with SCA.,Steady biological signs and crises from blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises-VOC) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA).

30216683,Introduction: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the major modifier for sickle cell disease (SCD) severity.,Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an important protein that affects the severity of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).
30216683,"HbF is modulated mainly by three major quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 2, 6, and 11.","HbF is changed mainly by three important quantitative trail loci (QTL-special sections of DNA) on chromosomes 2, 6, and 11."
30216683,"Methods: Five SNPs in the three QTLs (HBG2, rs7482144; BCL11A, rs1427407 and rs10189857; and HBS1L-MYB intergenic region, rs28384513 and rs9399137) were investigated by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization, and their roles in HbF and clinical phenotype variability in Iraqi Kurds with SCD were assessed.",Five single mutations in the three QTLs were studied.
30216683,Results:,The roles of these mutations in HbF were studied.
30216683,"HBG2 rs7482144 with minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.133 was the most significant contributor to HbF variability, contributing 18.1%, followed by rs1427407 (MAF of 0.266) and rs9399137 (MAF of 0.137) at 14.3% and 8.8%, respectively.",The research evaluated how these mutations affected the variety of characteristics seen in Iraqui Kurds with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).  
30216683,The other two SNPs were not significant contributors.,Three minor single mutations of the HBG2 gene resulted in the most important changes in HbF. The other two single mutations did not contribute significantly.
30216683,"Furthermore, when the cumulative numbers of minor alleles in the three contributing SNPs were assessed, HbF% and hemoglobin concentration increased with increasing number of minor alleles (P < 0.0005 and 0.001, respectively), while serum lactic dehydrogenase, reticulocytes, leukocytes, transfusion, and pain frequencies decreased (P = 0.003, 0.004, <0.0005, <0.0005, and 0.017, respectively).",An increase in the number of these minor single mutations resulted in an increase in the amount of HbF and hemoglobin.
30216683,Conclusions: It was demonstrated that SNPs in all three major HbF QTLs contribute significantly to HbF and clinical variability in Iraqi Kurds with SCD and that the cumulative number of minor alleles at contributing SNPs may serve as a better predictor of such variability in this population.,"This also resulted in a decrease in blood lactic dehydrogenase (an enzyme from tissue damage), white blood cells, transfusions, and occurences of pain."

30884939,"Popliteal cyst is a common peri-knee cyst, also known as a Baker's cyst.","Popliteal cyst, also known as Baker's cyst, occurs in the knee region."
30884939,"With the current development of popliteal cysts, the pathogenesis is mainly due to increased pressure in the knee joint caused by various reasons, leading to a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee as a result of enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa.",Popliteal cysts are caused by increased pressure on the knee joint which results in the abnormal enlargement of a bursa (protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee to form a cyst.
30884939,"The current diagnostic methods include X-ray computed, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance.","Orthopedic specialists can diagnose popliteal cysts using X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."
30884939,"Among them, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts.","MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis of popliteal cysts Treatment options for popliteal cysts include conservative treatment, traditional surgery, and arthroscopic surgery."

26137182,Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and may be related to size.,Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin occur infrequently and may depend on the size of the cyst A common normal variant of knee synovial tissue shows a capsule-shaped opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa ( a fluid-filled sac that lies between semimembranosus muscle and superficial muscle in the back part of the lower leg .)
26137182,Conclusion: A capsular opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa is a commonly found normal anatomic variant.,This variant may lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst due to chronic leakage of synovial fluid caused by intra-articular tissue damage .
26137182,It is thought that this can lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst in the presence of chronic knee effusions as a result of intra-articular pathology.,Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative.

1139040,"Following infusion of labeled cells, the recirculating portion of the labeled cells rapidly equilibrated with the total intravascular lymphocyte pool and the vastly larger total-body recirculating lymphocyte pool, so that by 1 hr following infusion 21.8% plus or minus 3.2% of the labeled lymphocytes were left in the circulation.","The recirculating or re-added part of the new lymphocyte cells returned to volunteers quickly balanced with the total lymphocyte pools and by 1 hour after the cells were put in the body, 21.8% were left in circulation."

1139040,"Concomitant with the lymphocytopenia there was a dramatic increase in lymphocyte specific activity (cpm per 10-6 lymphocytes), while the total lymphocyte-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was unchanged, indicating that corticosteroid administration depleted the unlabeled recirculating cells.",It caused a major but short-term lymphocytopenia (a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes in the blood) at 4 hours and then lymphocytes returned to normal levels by 24 hours after the injection.
1139040,"As the lymphocyte counts returned to normal following hydrocortisone, the specific activity also returned to normal.","Naturally occurring with lymphocytopenia was a big increase in lymphocyte (white blood cell) specific activity, while the total lymphocyte radioactivity (release of energy) in the circulation did not change, suggesting that corticosteroid administration reduced the recirculating cells that were not provided to the volunteers."

1078546,"4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia, with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations.","Four hours after receiving the prednisone, there is major lymphocytopenia (a condition where there is a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood), monocytopenia (a reduction of monocytes, a type of immune cell, in the blood), reduction of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection), and the presence of different lymphocyte subpopulations."
1078546,Lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool.,Studies that focus on lymphocyte reactions showed that lymphocytopenia is due to short-term reduction of white blood cells circulating within and outside cells.

1078546,"This very transient lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2-day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications.","The very short-term lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers and counts for the rest of the 2-day cycle, are connected with eliminating disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (showing a reaction in the skin after several days) and did not increase the chance of complications with infection."
1078546,"This drug-associated cyclic and transient monocytopenia and selective lymphocytopenia is best explained by a redistribution of recirculating lymphocytes to other body compartments, particularly the bone marrow.","The short-term monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia connected with this drug is best explained as the body redistributing lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to other parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow."

2199128,"Secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample.","Secondly, it is necessary to understand the free fraction, or portion of the drug that has an effect on the body, of prednisolone in each plasma (the liquid portion of blood) sample."
2199128,"Thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies.","Third, due to the short half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood) of prednisolone, there is no steady state (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates)."

2199128,"Finally, the total body clearances of total and (to a lesser degree) of unbound prednisolone increase with increasing concentrations of prednisolone.","Fourth, prednisolone and prednisone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other, and prednisolone is given intravenously or via injection."
2199128,"Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results between different subjects, standardised doses had to be administered.",These features create disagreement about the correct way to understand how the body is able to handle these drugs.
2199128,"The investigations performed so far have revealed that: (1) the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics partly explain the clinical observation that an alternate-day regimen with prednisone yields fewer biological effects; (2) the interconversion of prednisone into prednisolone is not a limiting factor, even in patients with severely impaired liver function; (3) hypoproteinaemia per se does not cause increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone in vivo; (4) patients with liver failure, renal failure or a renal transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing oral contraceptive steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole have increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone-whereas hyperthyroid patients, some patients with Crohn's disease, subjects taking microsomal liver enzyme-inducing agents or patients on intravenous prednisolone phthalate (instead of prednisolone phosphate) or on some brands of enteric coated prednisolone tablets have decreased concentrations of prednisolone.","Finally, the total amount of prednisolone that is cleared from the body and the total amount of prednisolone that has an effect on the body increase with more concentration of prednisolone."

2199128,"Secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample.","Secondly, prednisolone is connected to certain liver proteins."
2199128,"Thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies.","Since the unconnected amounts of prednisolone are important, it was necessary to measure the unconnected amount in each blood sample."
2199128,"Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interconvertible and prednisolone is given intravenously as an ester prodrug, features which created controversies about the correct interpretation of pharmacokinetic results.","Thirdly, due to the short span of prednisolone, no balance is achieved."

7310640,The pharmacokinetics of both oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were dose-dependent.,How prednisolone attaches to proteins in plasma are also measured.
7310640,The mean oral dose plasma clearances of prednisone ranged from 572 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 5 mg dose to 2271 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 50 mg dose.,The pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of both oral prednisone and IV prednisolone are dose-dependent (in which the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed).

7310640,The systemic plasma clearance of i.v. prednisolone was dose-dependent and increased from 111 to 194 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 5 to 40 mg i.v. dosage range.,How the body clears IV prednisolone from plasma is dose-dependent.
7310640,"The steady-state volume of distribution also increased, but little change in mean transit time and half-life was found.","The steady-state volume (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates) also increased, but little change in the average time and half-life is found."

7310640,"In urine, 2-5% of either administered drug was excreted as prednisone and 11-24% as prednisolone.",The observed renal (kidney-related) elimination or removal of both steroid drugs are also nonlinear (increases in drug exposure are not directly related to increases in given doses) and unrelated to protein attachment.
7310640,The apparent renal clearances of both steroids were also nonlinear and unrelated to protein binding.,These studies suggest that how the body handles prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that attaching to proteins does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and how it is absorbed and excreted in the body.

30848135,Methods: 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET treatment placed in the study.,This study aimed to predict the influence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) levels on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery.
30848135,"The influence of other factors: age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss and the possibility to predict multiple pregnancy was also related to the known hCG value.",This study evaluated 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET (lab-grown egg transfer) treatment.
30848135,The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs).,The influence of other factors on finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss was determined.
30848135,"The answer here, therefore, is a multinomial variable with four levels.","These factors included age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation."

27630909,Introduction: The presentation of Ectopic Pregnancy (EP) can be highly variable and serum Beta hCG estimation plays an important role in early diagnosis.,Signs of Ectopic (outer-uterus or outer-womb) Pregnancy (EP) can be highly variable.
27630909,Aim: Aim of the study was to determine the trends of hCG levels in EP and to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs.,Serum Beta hCG (a pregnancy hormone) estimation plays an important role in early diagnosis.
27630909,Materials and methods: A retrospective study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care centre in southern India was carried out.,The aim of the study was to determine trends of hCG levels in EP.
27630909,These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol.,This study also aimed to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs.
27630909,Results:,A study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care center in southern India was carried out.
27630909,The study identified 337 women with EP.,These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol.
27630909,Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml.,The study identified 337 women with EP.

24724425,The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG.,"However, spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan."
24724425,"A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients, including cases of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7, during medical treatment and comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels.",The purpose of this study was to understand if urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG.
24724425,"The histogram of relative urinary/serum hCG(U-hCG.act/S-hCG) of the samples showed a wide distribution of values, but tended to converge to a narrow distribution by creatinine correction (U-hCG.cor/S-hCG).",A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients.

24724425,The alteration of serum Intact/Total tended to be similar to that of U-hCG.cor/S-hCG in clinical course.,Sample comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels.
24724425,The presented case indicated that U-hCG.act/S-hCG did not correspond to serum hCG levels.,Hydatidiform mole leads to a cluster of fluid filled sacs from a noncancerous tumor developing in the uterus from a nonviable pregnancy.
24724425,"Because urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted, the levels of hCG in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG.",Initial analysis of sample urinary/serum hCG showed a wide distribution of values.
24724425,"Therefore, the data of urinary hCG should be interpreted after creatinine correction.","However, the difference in distribution decreased after sample normalization."
24724425,"Overall, it is recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than creatinine corrected urinary hCG levels, considering that the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant postoperatively.","Urinary/serum hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups showed no difference before or after surgery."

12090459,Objective: To examine whether zinc salts with low stability constants were more suitable as sources of zinc in zinc lozenges than zinc salts with high stability constants.,We studied which zinc salts are better to use in zinc lozenges.
12090459,"The former provide free zinc ions upon dissolution in water, whereas the latter provide few such ions.",Some zinc salts break down in water more easily and let out more free zinc.  
12090459,"Design and participants: Identical lozenges were produced which contained either zinc acetate, zinc gluconate (low stability constants), zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc (extremely high stability constants).",We prepared similar lozenges that contained one of the zinc salts that easily let out zinc (zinc acetate or zinc gluconate) or the chemicals that do not let zinc out easily (zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc).

12090459,VSC were measured by GC.,We measured the poor smelling sulfur gases.
12090459,Results and conclusion: The lozenge with the highest stability constant was as effective as those with very low stability constants.,All lozenges worked similarly.
12090459,The anti-VSC effect was thus not related to this constant.,This means that suppression of the sulfur chemicals by zinc is not related to how easily zinc salts dissolve in water.
12090459,These findings may be explained by the possibility that alternative ligands with stronger affinity for zinc than the original ligands in the lozenges may be present in the oral cavity.,Similar results for all lozenges may be due to some chemicals in the mouth interacting with zinc stronger than the salts in the lozenges.
12090459,An in vitro experiment indicated that the sulphide ion (S2-) may be such a ligand.,Lab experiments suggest the chemical in the mouth that interacts with zinc may be a form of sulfur.
12090459,The anti-VSC (volatile sulphur compounds) effect of zinc is known to be associated with free zinc ions.,"Zinc's anti-VSC (volatile sulphur compounds) effect comes from free zinc ions, which are the chemicals that allow zinc to work in the body."
12090459,Objective: To examine whether zinc salts with low stability constants were more suitable as sources of zinc in zinc lozenges than zinc salts with high stability constants.,"The objective of this study was to see which type of zinc lozenges work best, the type that has what is called high stability constants or the type that has low stability constants."
12090459,"The former provide free zinc ions upon dissolution in water, whereas the latter provide few such ions.","A lot of free zinc ions appear when low stability constant zinc is dissolved in water, which high stability constant zinc gives few ions."
12090459,"Design and participants: Identical lozenges were produced which contained either zinc acetate, zinc gluconate (low stability constants), zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc (extremely high stability constants).","All lozenges looked identical but contained one of four different types of zinc forms, two for each type of stability constants."
12090459,All the lozenges contained 0.1 per cent of zinc.,All of the lozenges contained a small amount of zinc.
12090459,A test panel of 10 volunteers used the different lozenges randomly.,10 volunteers took the different lozenges randomly.
12090459,VSC were measured by GC.,The results show that the zinc lozenges were effective no matter the stability constant.
12090459,Results and conclusion: The lozenge with the highest stability constant was as effective as those with very low stability constants.,The stability constant has no effect on the zinc ions' anti-VSC effect.
12090459,The anti-VSC effect was thus not related to this constant.,One explanation is that free zinc ions are attracted to chemicals in the mouth more strongly than those in the lozenge.
12090459,These findings may be explained by the possibility that alternative ligands with stronger affinity for zinc than the original ligands in the lozenges may be present in the oral cavity.,A lab experiment showed that sulphide ions from VSCs may attract free zinc ions to create the anti-VSC effect.

19306923,"Interestingly, the uptake of Zn(2+) from zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate was significantly higher than that of other salts, implicating a correlation between uptake and toxicity.","Zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate provided free zinc in higher doses then other salts, possibly indicating there is a connection between taking in zinc and its toxic effect on the cell."
19306923,"In conclusion, Zn(2+)-salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride(,) zinc-gluconate) and low cytotoxicity (zinc-histidinate).","Zinc salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride, zinc-gluconate) and low cell totoxicity (zinc-histidinate)."

33347023,Methods: We recruited 132 patients who were using different antidepressants and 58 healthy controls.  ,This study includes 132 people taking antidepressant drugs and 58 people not taking antidepressant drugs for comparison.
33347023,"Venlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, and sertraline were used by 34, 28, 36, and 34 patients, respectively.  ","Patients were taking the antidepressant drugs called venlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, and sertraline."
33347023,The participants filled out and completed the Beck Depression Scale.  ,Patients filled our a form to measure their level of depression.
33347023,"We recorded Schirmer test, tear breakup time (TBUT) and corneal staining values of the participants.  ",The researchers looked at the eyes and tears of the patients.
33347023,The Ocular Surface Disease Index was completed by the participants.  ,Patients filled out a form to measure the dryness of their eyes.
33347023,"In addition, we evaluated the tear meniscus parameters by using anterior segment optical coherence tomography.  ",Those people taking antidepressant drugs had drier eyes than those that were not taking antidepressant drugs.
33347023,"Results: All conventional dry eye tests and tear meniscus parameters were significantly lesser in the depression group than in the control group (Schirmer test, 11.41 ?? 6.73 mm and 22.53 ?? 4.98 mm; TBUT, 5.29 ?? 2.92 seconds and 13.38 ?? 1.72; Corneal staining, tear meniscus area, 0.026 ?? 0.012 mm2 and 0.11 ?? 0.025 mm2; tear meniscus depth, 182.75 ?? 78.79 ??m and 257.48 ?? 90.1 ??m; tear meniscus height, 290.3 ?? 133.63 ??m and 459.78 ?? 180.26 ??m, in patients and controls, respectively).  ",The people taking duloxetine had the driest eyes.
33347023,"The tear parameters of the duloxetine group were lowest among the drug groups and Schirmer test, and TBUT of the venlafaxine group was statistically significantly different from the duloxetine group (P = 0.028 and P = 0.017, respectively).  ",The people taking antidepressant drugs scored much higher on a test to measure dry eyes.
33347023,"Ocular Surface Disease Index score of the depression group was significantly higher than the control group (31.12 ?? 21.15 and 17.43 ?? 11.75 in depression and control group, respectively.).  ",This study finds that certain classes of antidepressant drugs affects the eye ducts but does not because the drugs affect the nerves.
33347023,Conclusions: We found that the usage of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors affects the ocular surface by a mechanism other than the anticholinergic system.  ,Using antidepressants from the drug class called serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors may lead to dry eyes.

31747213,"This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant drug-drug interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and related conditions.","This article describes the uses of the antidepressant, how it works, and medications that should not be used while taking it."
21366359,"Duloxetine, a potent reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine, is effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain, stress urinary incontinence, generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia.","Duloxetine blocks two chemical messengers from working, called serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine."
21366359,Duloxetine achieves a maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of approximately 47 ng/mL (40 mg twice-daily dosing) to 110 ng/mL (80 mg twice-daily dosing) approximately 6 hours after dosing.,"Duloxetine is given to treat things such as depression, diabetic nerve pain, leaky bladder, anxiety, and other chronic pain.  "
21366359,The elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 10-12 hours and the volume of distribution is approximately 1640 L.,The goal of this paper is to look at other studies on duloxetine to see if the drug can be used with other drugs.
21366359,The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine with a focus on concomitant medications and their clinical implications.,"Things that affect the way that duloxetine works are your sex, age, ethnicity, whether you smoke or not, the condition of your kidney and liver, and your genetics."
21366359,"Patient demographic characteristics found to influence the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine include sex, smoking status, age, ethnicity, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype, hepatic function and renal function.",A doctor will only have warnings against using duloxetine if your liver or kidneys are not in good condition.
21366359,"Of these, only impaired hepatic function or severely impaired renal function warrant specific warnings or dose recommendations.","Studies show that activated charcoal, used to treat certain poisons, makes duloxetine less effective."
21366359,"Pharmacokinetic results from drug interaction studies show that activated charcoal decreases duloxetine exposure, and that CYP1A2 inhibition increases duloxetine exposure to a clinically significant degree.",Taking drugs that affect a certain enzyme with duloxetine could make you sick.
21366359,"Specifically, following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and C(max) of duloxetine significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively.","Taking the drug fluvoxamine, used to treat depression and OCD, with duloxetine could make you sick."

21366359,"In addition, duloxetine increases the exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, but not CYP1A2.",There are certain drugs that should not be taken with duloxetine because they can make you sick when taking them normally.
21366359,"Pharmacodynamic study results indicate that duloxetine may enhance the effects of benzodiazepines, but not alcohol or warfarin.","Studies show that duloxetine may make tranquilizers like valium and xanax stronger, but does not seem to affect alcohol or the blood thinner warfarin."
21366359,An increase in gastric pH produced by histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists or antacids did not impact the absorption of duloxetine.,Antacids and other stomach acid blockers do not affect duloxetine.
21366359,"While duloxetine is generally well tolerated, it is important to be knowledgeable about the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between duloxetine and drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 or drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes.",It is important that your doctors know what drugs you are taking in order to make sure you do not get sick from taking duloxetine.

33542006,The patient was a 40-year-old woman experiencing sudden difficulty in mouth opening and speaking due to a stiffened jaw after taking 5 days of duloxetine prescribed for her fibromyalgia-related chest pain.,The patient was a 40-year-old woman who was having trouble with opening her mouth and speaking five days after starting the drug duloxetine.
33542006,Assessment of vital signs is prudent to ensure there is no laryngeal involvement.,The woman's doctors found no other problems that might cause her jaw stiffness.
33542006,Other physical examinations and her recent investigations were unremarkable.,She was treated for muscle spasms with an IV and pills.
33542006,She was treated for acute dystonia and intravenous procyclidine was given together with oral diazepam.,The woman improved right away and was told to stop taking duloxetine.
33542006,Her symptoms improved immediately and her duloxetine was suggested to be stopped.,This is the first time the authors have heard of jaw stiffness being caused by the drug duloxetine.
33542006,"To our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated trismus induced by duloxetine.",Doctors should be aware of the risk of jaw stiffness since it could lead to very serious problems.
32874005,We present a case of hypertensive urgency in a diabetic patient with painful diabetic neuropathy on duloxetine treatment.,This paper is about a patient with pain caused by diabetes who went to the doctor with very serious high blood pressure.
32874005,The patient's blood pressure was high after taking 1-day dose of duloxetine and the patient was diagnosed with hypertensive urgency.,The patient's blood pressure was high after taking a 1-day dose of the antidepressant duloxetine (a drug that also treats diabetic nerve pain).
32874005,"The patient was treated with labetalol, leading to reduction in blood pressure.",The patient was diagnosed with a high blood pressure emergency.
32874005,"The patient's medication was switched to telmisartan and metoprolol, which leads to resolution of increased blood pressure.","The patient was given labetalol, a drug that lowers blood pressure."
32874005,This case report is a possible case of hypertensive urgency after the initiation of duloxetine managed with antihypertensives and resolves with the discontinuation of the duloxetine.,"The patient was switched to the drugs telmisartan and metoprolol, which treat high blood pressure."
32546134,Background: Antidepressants-induced movement disorders are rare and imperfectly known adverse drug reactions.,"A rare side effect of taking antidepressant drugs is uncontrollable movement, also called movement disorders."
32546134,The risk may differ between different antidepressants and antidepressants' classes.,There may be different side effects depending on what antidepressant drugs you take.
32546134,The objective of this study was to assess the putative association of each antidepressant and antidepressants' classes with movement disorders.,This study tried to figure out which antidepressant drugs caused which movement disorder side effects.
32546134,"Methods: Using VigiBase??, the WHO Pharmacovigilance database, disproportionality of movement disorders' reporting was assessed among adverse drug reactions related to any antidepressant, from January 1967 to February 2017, through a case/non-case design.",This study looked at reports of antidepressant use from 1967 to 2017 using a computer database.
32546134,"The association between nine subtypes of movement disorders (akathisia, bruxism, dystonia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, tics, tremor) and antidepressants was estimated through the calculation first of crude Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), then adjusted ROR on four potential confounding factors: age, sex, drugs described as able to induce movement disorders, and drugs used to treat movement disorders.",This study used statistics to see if the links between the different antidepressants and movement disorders.
32546134,"Results: Out of the 14,270,446 reports included in VigiBase??, 1,027,405 (7.2%) contained at least one antidepressant, among whom 29,253 (2.8%) reported movement disorders.",There were over 14 million reports in the database.
32546134,The female/male sex ratio was 2.15 and the mean age 50.9 ?? 18.0 years.,One million of those contained a report of antidepressant use.

32546134,"When comparing each of the classes of antidepressants with the others, a significant association was observed for all subtypes of movement disorders except restless legs syndrome with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) only.",The patients in the reports ranged from 32-68 years old and contained twice as many women as men.
32546134,"Among antidepressants, mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amoxapine, phenelzine, tryptophan and fluvoxamine were associated with the highest level to movement disorders and citalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine and mirtazapine were the most frequently associated with movement disorders.",All movement disorders were linked to antidepressant use.
32546134,An association was also found with eight other antidepressants.,"Jaw clenching was seen the most often, and involuntary movement called tics were the least seen."
32546134,"Conclusions: A potential harmful association was found between movement disorders and use of the antidepressants mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amoxapine, phenelzine, tryptophan, fluvoxamine, citalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, bupropion, clomipramine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, mianserin, sertraline, venlafaxine and vilazodone.",The anitdepressant drug class called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) were most often linked to movement disorders except for restless leg syndrome.
32546134,Clinicians should beware of these adverse effects and monitor early warning signs carefully.,"The antidepressants linked to the strongest movement disorders, like Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, were mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amoxapine, phenelzine, tryptophan, and fluvoxamine."
32546134,"However, this observational study must be interpreted as an exploratory analysis, and these results should be refined by future epidemiological studies.","The antidepressants with the most movement disorder side effects were citalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine."

25229278,"For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins can be an acceptable alternative, although primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins can occur.",Immediate strep throat is often a self-resolving disease.
25229278,Another drug option is the macrolides.,"Penicillins, or antibacterial drugs, are the first-choice treatment."

33178623,"The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is infection by Group A ??-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), commonly known as strep throat.",Strep throat caused by bacteria is most commonly caused by group A strep bacteria.
33178623,5-15% of adults and 15-35% of children in the United States with pharyngitis have a GABHS infection.,5-15% of adults and 15-35% children in the United States with strep throat have a group A strep bacteria infection.
33178623,"The symptoms of GABHS overlap with non-GABHS and viral causes of acute pharyngitis, complicating the problem of diagnosis.","The symptoms of group A strep bacteria are similar to short-term strep throat caused by viruses and other bacteria, which makes strep throat hard to diagnose."
33178623,A careful physical examination and patient history is the starting point for diagnosing GABHS.,Diagnosing strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria begins with a careful physical exam and patient history.
33178623,"After a physical examination and patient history is completed, five types of diagnostic methods can be used to ascertain the presence of a GABHS infection: clinical scoring systems, rapid antigen detection tests, throat culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, and machine learning and artificial intelligence.","Following a physical exam and patient history, there are five ways to diagnose strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria: scoring systems, rapid antigen tests to find strep bacterial fragments, throat swabs to grow strep bacteria, tests for strep genetic material, and computer predictions."
33178623,Clinical guidelines developed by professional associations can help medical professionals choose among available techniques to diagnose strep throat.,Clinical guidelines written by professional groups can help doctors choose which way to diagnose strep throat.
33178623,"However, guidelines for diagnosing GABHS created by the American and European professional associations vary significantly, and there is substantial evidence that most physicians do not follow any published guidelines.","However, guidelines for diagnosing group A strep throat created by professional groups in the United States and Europe differ, and many doctors do not follow any guidelines."
33178623,"Treatment for GABHS using analgesics, antipyretics, and antibiotics seeks to provide symptom relief, shorten the duration of illness, prevent nonsuppurative and suppurative complications, and decrease the risk of contagion, while minimizing the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","Treating group A strep throat with painkillers, fever-reducers, and antibiotics aims to relieve symptoms, shorten illness length, prevent later medical problems with pus or without pus, and decrease the spread, while reducing the use of antibiotics when they are not needed."
33178623,There is broad agreement that antibiotics with narrow spectrums of activity are appropriate for treating strep throat.,Experts agree that antibiotics that kill fewer bacteria are best to treat strep throat.
33178623,But whether and when patients should be treated with antibiotics for GABHS remains a controversial question.,Experts do not agree whether and when people with group A strep throat should be given antibiotics.
33178623,"There is no clearly superior management strategy for strep throat, as significant controversy exists regarding the best methods to diagnose GABHS and under what conditions antibiotics should be prescribed.","There is no best way to treat strep throat, as experts do not agree on the best way to diagnose group A strep throat and when antibiotics should be given."

26048677,Introduction:,Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) (a sleep disorder of recurring episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep) is one of the causes of atrial fibrillation (AF) (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke).

19009769,Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is associated with different types of cardiac arrhythmias.,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) occurs as muscles in the throat relax and the airway narrows or closes, and breathing is momentarily cut off."
19009769,"The original studies, concentrated mostly on nocturnal brady- and tachyarrhythmias.",OSA is associated with different types of cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat occuring when electrical impulses in the heart do not work properly).
19009769,More recent studies documented high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its association with obesity and other risk factors for AF.,Past studies mostly focus on nighttime heartbeats that are too slow (bradyarrhythmias) or too fast (tachyarrhythmias).
19009769,"In addition, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents recurrence of AF after cardioversion.",Recent studies document very common occurrences of atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots in the heart) and their association with obesity and other risk factors for atrial fibrillation.
19009769,"In, OSA the highest risk for sudden death is at night in comparison to general population most of who die suddenly between six and noon.","In addition, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device to help people with OSA breathe more easily while sleeping, prevent atrial fibrillation from returning after cardioversion (a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm)."
19009769,"This observation suggests that hypoxia or other nocturnal abnormality, trigger sudden death.","For people with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, the highest risk for sudden death is at night."
19009769,An important recent finding is the beneficial effect of CPAP on sudden death.,This observation suggests that hypoxia (not enough oxygen in the tissues for the body to function properly) or other nighttime abnormalities trigger sudden death.

30571183,"Background: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in genes, encoding the cardiac potassium channel subunits KCNJ2, KCNE1, and KCNH2 that mediate the repolarizing potassium currents Ik1, Iks, and Ikr, respectively.",Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) can be caused by mutations in genes.
30571183,"Methods: Linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology studies were used in this study.","Genetic linkage analysis to trace diseases in families using genes, whole-exome sequencing to find a genetic cause of a disease, and models to study biological processes of cells were used in this study."
30571183,"Results: Through genetic studies, we showed that autosomal dominant early-onset nocturnal paroxysmal AF is caused by p.S447R mutation in KCND2, encoding the pore-forming (??) subunit of the Kv4.2 cardiac potassium channel.","Through these genetic studies, researchers show that one genetic trait or mutation that is passed down from parent to child causing nighttime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is caused by a mutation in the KCND2 gene."
30571183,"Kv4.2, along with Kv4.3, contributes to the cardiac fast transient outward K+ current, Ito.","Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are potassium channels that release potassium from cells and contribute to the heart-related, temporary, fast, outward potassium (K+) current, Ito."
30571183,"Ito underlies the early phase of repolarization in the cardiac action potential, thereby setting the initial potential of the plateau phase and governing its duration and amplitude.","Ito is the base of the early phase of repolarization (when the outward current of ions exceeds the inward current) in the cardiac action potental (where unique properties necessary for function of the electrical conduction system of the heart occur), and creates the initial potential of the plateau phase (the time that allows for longer muscle contraction and allows the heart to contract in a steady, uniform, and forceful manner)."
30571183,"In Xenopus oocytes, the mutation increased the channel's inactivation time constant and affected its regulation: p.","In studies that modeled the cell's biology, the mutation increased the potassium channel's inactivation time (the time when the channel no longer allows potassium to be passed through it) and affected its regulation."
30571183,"S447 resides in a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site, which normally allows attenuation of Kv4.2 membrane expression.","The mutant Kv4.2 showed an impaired response to protein kinase C (PKC), a protein that regulates cells growth and plays a major role in sending signals to the heart.  "
30571183,"The mutant Kv4.2 exhibited impaired response to PKC; hence, Kv4.2 membrane expression was augmented, enhancing potassium currents.","The gene mutation alters Kv4.2's transfer properties, impairs its regulation process, and exerts gain-of-function effect (changes the activity or function of a protein) in both Kv4.2 and Kv4.2-Kv4.3 potassium channels."
30571183,Coexpression of mutant and wild-type channels (recapitulating heterozygosity in affected individuals) showed results similar to the mutant channel alone.,"These effects possibly increase the repolarizing potassium current Ito, creating arrhythmogenic substrates (factors that can produce or lead to arrhythmia) for nocturnal atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm occuring at night that can lead to blood clots in the heart)."
30571183,"Finally, in a hybrid channel composed of Kv4.3 and Kv4.2, simulating the mature endogenous heterotetrameric channel underlying Ito, the p.S447R","Kv4.2 expression has previously been shown to demonstrate circadian variation (the natural, internal process that regulates the sleep??wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours), with peak expression at daytime, with possible relevance to the nighttime onset of symptoms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) in patients."

12224233,The patient who presents with a serious head injury is often very difficult to manage.,A person with a serious head injury is often very difficult to treat.
12224233,The airways is of primary concern; adequate ventilation must be provided and aspiration protected against.,"The airways are the most important concern; enough air movement must be provided, and material entering the airway or lungs by accident must be avoided."
12224233,Recent studies suggest that hyperventilation may be as beneficial as was earlier believed.,Recent studies suggest that quick breathing or hyperventilation may be as helpful as was thought before.
12224233,"As the pCO2 level decreases, vasoconstriction occurs.","As the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood decreases, blood vessels narrow."
12224233,"If the level falls too low, cerebral perfusion is restricted, and profound cerebral anoxia may ensue.","If the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood gets too low, blood flow to the brain is limited, and not enough oxygen getting to the brain may follow."
12224233,"Current standards call for a ventilatory rate to allow for moderate respiratory alkalosis, in theory to mildly constrict teh vessels but still provide adequate perfusion.","Current standards suggest a rate of movement of air into and out of the lungs to allow for a decrease in carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood, in theory to narrow the vessels but still allow enough circulation of blood through organs and tissues."
12224233,Arterial blood gas analysis in the ED is the definitive measurement of airway management in the field.,Measuring oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood in the emergency department is the best measurement of airway treatment by first responders.
12224233,Remember that the anatomy of the meningeal layers places the arteries primarily in the epidural space and the veins in the subdural space.,Remember that the structure of the brain's protective layers puts the arteries in the space between the outermost layer and the skull (epidural) and the veins in the space between the outermost layer and the brain (subdural).
12224233,"A bleed in the epidural space often presents with a rapid onset of signs and symptoms, as was obvious in this traumatized patient.","A bleed in the epidural space often has quick signs and symptoms, as was obvious in this injured patient."
12224233,"When a bleed occurs in the subdural space, the onset is usually more insidious, and an accurate history is a key to field diagnosis.","A bleed in the subdural space usually happens more slowly, and knowing what happened to the person is key to a diagnosis by first responders."
12224233,"As the hemorrhage expands, compression displaces the brain within the cranial vault.","As the bleeding spreads, pressure pushing on the brain moves the brain within the skull."
12224233,This displacement causes pressure to be exerted on the medulla of the brainstem.,This movement of the brain puts pressure on the area of the brain that controls things like heartbeat and breathing (medulla).
12224233,Cushing's Traid is a result of this pressure on the medulla and is evidence by the pulse slowing while systolic blood pressure rises and respirations become ataxic.,"Pressure on the medulla causes Cushing's Triad, which is a slowing heartbeat while blood pressure increases and breathing becomes abnormal."
12224233,"Vomiting is often associated, and as the bleed continues, herniation syndrome begins.","Vomiting often occurs, and as the bleed continues, something inside the skull produces pressure that moves brain tissues."
12224233,"Decorticate posturing is displayed, followed by decerebrate posturing if relief is not provided.","A person gets stiff with bent arms, clenched fists, and legs held out straight (decorticate posturing), followed by the arms and legs being held straight out, the toes being pointed downward, and the head and neck being arched backward (decerebrate posturing) if relief is not given."

12224233,"The cerebral cortex lies above the cerebellum, so when a patient's arms flexed up toward the face , he is pointing to his ""core"" (de-cor-ticate).","One part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, lies above another part of the brain, the cerebellum, so when a patient's arms point toward the face, he is pointing to his ""core"" (de-cor-ticate)."
12224233,"As the arms extend downward, he is pointing to his cerebellum(de-cere-brate).","As the arms go down to his side, he is pointing to his cerebellum (de-cere-brate)."
12224233,"T o manage the head-injured patient, it is imperative to anticipate potential developments, as well as protect against underlying injuries that may not be fully evaluated until arrival at the ED.","To treat the patient with a head injury, it is important to predict what might happen, and protect against other injuries that may not be realized until the patient gets to the hospital."
12224233,"Cervical spine often accompany head injuries, and full spinal immobilization is a mandatory precaution in all presentations.","Neck injuries often happen with head injuries, and making sure the spine cannot move is required in all cases."
12224233,"With the expanding hematoma found on this patient's neck, vascular damage ws obvious and contributed to the suspicion of spinal injury.","With the growing bruise on this patient's neck, damage to blood vessels was clear and helped lead to the belief of a spinal injury."
12224233,"As the intracranial pressure rise, vomiting and seizures are common.","As the pressure in the brain rises, vomiting and seizures are common."
12224233,Placement of an endotracheal tube and having suction equipment ready are the best tools to prevent against aspiration.,Putting in a breathing tube and having suction tools ready are the best ways to prevent material entering the airway or lungs by accident.
12224233,"It is possible to angle the long spine board 10-15 degrees, exercising caution to ensure the patient's spinal alignment is not manipulated during the process.","It is possible to angle the rescue board 10-15 degrees, making sure to not change the alignment of the patient's spine."
12224233,Seizures are usually treated with anticonvulsants like Valium.,"Seizures are usually treated with drugs that prevent convulsions, like Valium."
12224233,"When a seizure accompanies a head injury, it is a direct result of the increased intracranial pressure and has a generally poor response to Valium, as the underlying cause of the seizure still exists.","When a seizure happens with a head injury, it is caused by rising pressure in the brain, and Valium does not usually help, as the cause for the seizure is not resolved."
12224233,"In this case, the patient had a full neuromuscular blockade, and any seizure would not have been recognized as long as the paralytics were on board.","In this case, the patient had a full nerve block (paralyzed skeletal muscles)."
12224233,"Early notification to the ED is essential, reporting all findings and interventions.",Any seizure would not have been seen while the paralyzing drugs were working.
12224233,"This can alert them and give them the opportunity to prepare specialized equipment, such as CT scanners, mechanical ventilators, etc.","Notifying the emergency department is very important, reporting everything the first responders see and do to treat the patient."
12224233,"Also, consider transportation options and the length of time to definitive care, including neurosurgical evaluation.","This can warn emergency staff and give them the chance to get specialized equipment ready (e.g., CT scanners, mechanical ventilators)."
12224233,This patient needs to be seen in a trauma center capable of the most thorough evaluation and management.,"Also, think about how to get the patient to the hospital and how much time it will take to best care for the patient, including seeing a brain surgeon."

30565220,Authors' conclusions: The studies included in this review provided mostly low- or very low-certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning.,The studies in this review provided mostly unreliable evidence about using first aid treatments for immediate oral poisoning.
30565220,"A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre-hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting.","An key limitation is that only one study actually occured in a pre-hospital setting, which weakens our faith in the usefulness of these results to this setting."

30784327,Introduction:,"In poisoning caused by swallowing a toxic substance once or many times over a short period of time, any first aid assistance that reduces or delays how much is swallowed, and which ones bystanders can do, might help in reducing illness."
30784327,"In acute oral poisoning, any first aid intervention that limits or delays the uptake of the ingested substance, and which can be performed by bystanders as first responders, might assist in reducing morbidity if a toxic substance has been ingested.",The International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies recommends a victim be placed on the person's left side.
30784327,The current recommendation by the International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies is to place a victim in the left lateral decubitus position.,We conclude that the studies provide unreliable results.
30784327,Conclusions: The identified studies provide evidence of very low certainty.,"However, based on studies that show placing a person on the person's left side may decrease absorption of many drugs, and the ease and low risk of doing so, the recommendation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies stands."
1536482,Study objectives: Many factors influence the rate of gastric emptying and therefore the rate of drug absorption in the orally poisoned patient.,Many things determine how fast the stomach empties and therefore how fast a drug is taken in by the body in a person who swallows a toxic substance.
1536482,"Limited studies have evaluated the effect of body position on the rate of gastric emptying of radiographically marked foods and contrast media, but effects on drug absorption have not been studied previously.",Few studies have rated the effect of body position on how fast the stomach empties via a technique to more easily see stomach contents with x-rays.
1536482,Our hypothesis was that body position would have an effect on the rate of drug absorption in an oral overdose model.,"However, effects on how fast a drug is absorbed have not been studied before."
1536482,Design:,We thought that body position would have an effect on how fast a drug is absorbed in a person who swallows a toxic substance.
1536482,"A blinded, within-subjects (crossover) design.","Participants were six male and six female healthy, adult volunteers not taking any drugs or medicine affecting stomach function."
1536482,"Participants: Six male and six female healthy, adult volunteer subjects with no concurrent drug use or medications affecting gastrointestinal function.","We looked at five body positions often used before hospital and emergency room treatment: left side, right side, back, stomach, and sitting."
1536482,"Interventions: Five body positions commonly used in prehospital and emergency department settings were examined: left lateral decubitus, right lateral decubitus, supine, prone, and sitting.",Participants did every position in random order with a 3-day break between trials.
1536482,All were performed by all subjects in random order with a three-day washout phase between trials.,"To pretend that participants swallowed a toxic substance, participants did not eat prior to taking 80 mg of Tylenol/kg of body weight in the form of 160-mg children's tablets."
1536482,"To simulate an acute overdose, fasted subjects ingested 80 mg/kg acetaminophen in the form of 160-mg pediatric tablets.",Each participant then stayed in the body position for that trial for two hours.
1536482,Each subject then remained in the body position for that trial for two hours.,We measured Tylenol levels every 15 minutes.
1536482,"Acetaminophen levels were obtained at 15-minute intervals, and a two-hour area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each subject trial to represent total drug absorption during each study period.",We calculated how much Tylenol participants absorbed over 2 hours for each trial.
1536482,Investigators were blinded to all results until all trials were completed.,Investigators did not know the results until after the trials were done.
1536482,Measurements and main results: All subjects completed the study.,All participants finished the study.
1536482,Group mean drug absorption as represented by two-hour AUC (mg.L.min) was calculated for each body position.,We calculated average amount of drug absorbed for each body position.
1536482,"AUC for left lateral decubitus (6,006 +/- 2,614) was lowest but did not significantly differ from that for supine (6,649 +/- 2,761).","The average amount of drug absorbed was lowest for the left side, which was similar to the back position."
1536482,"Both were significantly less than those for prone (7,432 +/- 1,809), right lateral decubitus (8,950 +/- 1,405), and sitting (8,608 +/- 1,725) positions (P less than .05 by one-way analysis of variance and follow-up paired t tests).","Absorption for the left side and back were less than for stomach, right side, and sitting positions."
1536482,Conclusion: Initial drug absorption as determined by two-hour AUC was lowest in the left lateral decubitus position.,We concluded that drug absorption was lowest for the left side position.
1536482,"Although the difference between the left lateral decubitus and supine positions did not reach statistical significance, both left lateral decubitus and supine were significantly lower than three other common patient body positions tested.","Although the difference between the left side and back positions did not differ significantly, both the left side and back positions were significantly lower than the three other positions tested."
1536482,"Because the left lateral decubitus position has other advantages (eg, prevention of aspiration) in addition to minimizing drug absorption, we recommend that orally poisoned patients be placed in the left lateral decubitus position for prehospital and initial ED management.","Because the left side position is better for other reasons (e.g., material entering the airway or lungs by accident) than decreasing how much drug is absorbed, we suggest that people who swallow a toxic substance be put in the left side position before going to the hospital and emergency room."

34368314,"Background: As a highly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wreaking havoc around the world due to continuous spread among close contacts mainly via droplets, aerosols, contaminated hands or surfaces.","Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, is a highly contagious, viral, breathing-related disease that has caused world-wide distress."
34368314,"Therefore, centralized isolation of close contacts and suspected patients is an important measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.","Continual spread of COVID-19 occurs between people in close contact with one another through coughing, sneezing, breathing, talking, and touching dirty hands or surfaces."
34368314,"At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. Since COVID-19 patients in the incubation period are also contagious, cases with an incubation period of more than 14 d need to be evaluated.","To prevent further spread of COVID-19, a period of quarantine (isolation) is recommended for those suspected of having COVID-19 and/or those who believe they have come in contact with a COVID-19-infected person."
34368314,Case summary: A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University on April 5 due to a cough with sputum and shortness of breath.,"In most countries, the recommended quarantine duration is 14 days."
34368314,"On April 10, the patient was transferred to the Fever Clinic for further treatment due to close contact to one confirmed COVID-19 patient in the same room.","This is because the incubation period, or the time between exposure and the first signs of illness, of respiratory or breathing-related illnesses is normally between 4 to 7.5 days."
34368314,"During the period from April 10 to May 6, nucleic acid and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested 7 and 4 times, respectively, all of which were negative.","However, potential COVID-19 patients are still contagious during the incubation period."
34368314,"On May 7, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39???, and his respiratory difficulties had deteriorated.",Cases with incubation periods longer than 14 days need further evaluation by doctors.
34368314,The results of nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 were positive.,"For example, a 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on April 5th, reporting a cough, the spitting up of saliva and mucus, and shortness of breath."
34368314,"On May 8, the nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control were also positive, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.","On April 10th, the man was transferred to the Fever Clinic within the hospital for additional treatment as he had experienced close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient."
34368314,Conclusion:,"From April 10th to May 6th, the man was tested for COVID-19 several times."
34368314,This case highlights the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period.,"All tests returned negative, detecting no COVID-19."
34368314,Further epidemiological investigations and clinical observations are urgently needed to identify the optimal incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and formulate rational and evidence-based quarantine policies for COVID-19 accordingly.,"On May 7th, the man developed a severe fever, and his breathing issues become worse."
32150748,"Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019.","In December 2019, a new human coronavirus that affects the breathing or respiratory system, known as COVID-19, was identified in China."
32150748,"There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019","Little is known about how COVID-19 impacts human health, including how long the disease's incubation period (the time between initial exposure and the first signs of illness) lasts."

32150748,Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications.,The goal of this paper was to estimate the length of the COVID-19 incubation period and how it impacts the public's health.
32150748,Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020.,"To reach this goal, the authors reviewed confirmed COVID-19 cases that were reported between January 4th to February 24th in 2020."
32150748,"Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China.",The information was gathered from news reports and press releases from over 50 locations outside of Wuhan city within the Hubei province of China.
32150748,"Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China.",Only people with confirmed COVID-19 infection outside of the Hubei province of China were of interest for the evaluation.
32150748,Measurements:,"Patient characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity) and specific health measurements (e.g. dates of exposure, start of symptoms) were reviewed."
32150748,"Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization.","In total, 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases with definable exposure points and start of symptoms were evaluated for incubation period estimation."
32150748,Results:,The average incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days.
32150748,There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19.,"Overall, the majority of people will develop symptoms within 11.5 days after time of infection."
32150748,"The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.","These estimates imply that a portion of the population (101 out of every 10,000 COVID-19 patients) will show symptoms after 14 days of quarantine."
32150748,"These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.","Because only cases from new outlets and press releases were evaluated, the estimations may be based on more severe COVID-19 cases."
32150748,"Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.","Mild cases, which may go unreported, may have a different incubation period."
32150748,"Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.","Even though the data for mild COVID-19 cases may differ, this estimate provides support for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of 5 days."
32150748,"Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.",This estimation may help in the creation of appropriate quarantine measures for persons potentially exposed to COVID-19.

32941052,"Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented.","However, real-world studies that detect COVID-19 genetic material in the environment report very low levels."
32941052,"The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called ""superspreading events.""",Few have been able to grow the virus from these samples.

32473952,There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but the presence of viral RNA on a test does not necessarily correlate with infectivity.,The are several reports of people infected with COVID-19 being active spreaders of the virus for extended periods of time.
32473952,The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain.,"However, the results of COVID-19 tests do not always correlate to the duration of time a person can spread the virus."
32473952,"In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread.",Meaning a person can test negative but may be actively giving the virus to others unknowingly.

35139036,Results:,"We found that memory cells (immune cells that ""remember"" having encountered an infection before) are still detectable 8 months after vaccination, while viral antibody blood levels decline significantly, especially in previously unexposed people."
35139036,"We found that memory cells are still detectable 8 months after vaccination, while antibody levels decline significantly especially in na????ve subjects.","We also found that a booster shot is effective in reactivating immunity to the virus spike protein in previously unexposed people, while it is ineffective in people who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."
35139036,"We also found that a booster injection is efficacious in reactivating immunological memory to spike protein in na????ve subjects, while it results ineffective in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.","Finally, we found a similar reduction of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 up to one year following natural infection in a group of unvaccinated individuals."
35139036,"Finally, we observed a similar kinetics of decay of humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 up to one year following natural infection in a cohort of unvaccinated individuals.","We conclude that short-term immunity, together with the reduced ability of the immune system to block the newer strains of SARS-CoV-2, might account for breakthrough infections in vaccinated people and reinfections in people who were previously infected."
35139036,"Conclusion: Short-term persistence of humoral immunity, together with the reduced neutralization capacity versus the currently prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants, may account for reinfections and breakthrough infections.","A booster dose restores the strongest immunity against the viral spike protein in unexposed people, but it is not clear if people who have recovered from COVID-19 need to have a booster."
35132427,"Recognizing that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels wane over time following the 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA series, the FDA approved a booster dose for people greater than 12 years old.","After vaccination with the 2-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, blood levels of antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 drop over time."
35132427,Limited data exist on whether a booster dose of the mRNA vaccine results in greater antibody protection than the primary series.,"To increase blood levels of antibodies again, the FDA approved a booster dose for people greater than 12 years old."
35132427,"We examined total and neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralizing antibodies against Washington-1 (WA-1) and variants of concern (VOC) including Beta, Delta and Omicron in a longitudinal cohort.","However, limited data exist on whether a booster dose of the mRNA vaccine results in greater antibody protection than the primary series."
35132427,"Healthcare workers (HWs) were included in the analysis if serum was collected 1) within 14-44 days post-dose2 of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Timepoint 1, TP1), or 2) at least 8 months post-dose2 (Timepoint 2, TP2), or 3) within 14-44 days following mRNA booster (Timepoint 3, TP3).","We measured the blood levels of all types of antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and a specific type of antibodies - called neutralizing antibodies - against Washington-1 and other variants of concern including Beta, Delta and Omicron."
35132427,HWs with prior covid-positive PCR were excluded.,We followed the trends in antibody levels at several points in time after vaccination.
35132427,"We found that there is little to no neutralizing capability following a 2-dose mRNA vaccine series against the omicron variant, and neutralizing capacity to any variant strain tested has been lost by 8-months post two-dose vaccination series.","Healthcare workers were included in the analysis if serum was collected within 14-44 days post-dose 2 of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, or at least 8 months post-dose 2, or within 14-44 days following an mRNA booster shot."
35132427,"However, the mRNA booster series eliminates the immune escape observed by the omicron variant with the two-dose series.",Healthcare workers who had previously tested positive to COVID-19 were excluded from this study.
35132427,Neutralizing titers were significantly higher for all variants post-boost compared to the titers post two-dose series.,We found that there are few to no neutralizing antibodies produced against the omicron variant following a 2-dose mRNA vaccine series.
35132427,"The longitudinal nature of our cohort facilitated the analysis of paired samples pre and post boost, showing a greater than 15-fold increase in neutralization against omicron post-boost in these paired samples.","By 8-months post two-dose vaccination series, no neutralizing antibodies remain in blood circulation."
35132427,An mRNA booster dose provides greater quantity and quality of antibodies compared to a two-dose regimen and is critical to provide any protection against the omicron variant.,"However, the mRNA booster reactivates immunity to the omicron variant after the two-dose vaccination."

35131043,"The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021.","The data were from all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccines, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021."
35131043,Two outcomes were evaluated.,Two outcomes were evaluated.

35123028,Objectives: To determine the status of immune responses after primary and booster immunization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variants and evaluate the differences in disease-resistance based upon titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the variants.,We studied the immune response after primary and booster immunization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variants.
35123028,"Methods: Participants aged 18 - 59 y received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, 14 days apart, and a booster dose after 12 m. Blood samples were collected before vaccination (baseline), 1 and 6 m after primary immunization, and at multiple instances within 21 d of booster dose.",We evaluated the differences in disease resistance based upon blood levels of neutralizing antibodies (antibodies that inactivate the virus) against the variants.
35123028,NAbs against the spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 and three variants were measured using pseudovirus neutralization assays.,"Participants aged 18 - 59 years old received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, 14 days apart, and a booster dose after 12 months."

35123028,"After 3 d of booster immunization, GMTs were unaltered, seroconversion rates reached approximately 50% after 7 d, and GMTs of NAbs against all strains peaked at 14 d. Conclusion: Two-dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine induced the formation of NAbs and memory-associated immune responses, and high titers of NAbs against the variants obtained after booster immunization may further improve the effectiveness of the vaccine.","After 1 month of primary immunization, blood levels of neutralizing antibodies peaked for Wuhan-Hu-1, while blood levels against other variants were lower."
35144968,Objectives: To estimate the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 at different time after vaccination.,We studied the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 at different times after vaccination.
35144968,Design:,"This study was performed in Italy from December 27, 2020 to November 7, 2021."
35144968,Retrospective cohort study.,The participants included people aged 16 years and older who received a first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and did not have a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
35144968,"Setting: Italy, 27 December 2020 to 7 November 2021.",We tracked the number of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 (admission to hospital or death).
35144968,Participants: 33 250 344 people aged ??????16 years who received a first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and did not have a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,The data was calculated for each week following vaccination.
35144968,Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 (admission to hospital or death).,The incidence rate of infection at different time intervals was estimated using statistical models.
35144968,Data were divided by weekly time intervals after vaccination.,"We recorded the sex, age group, brand of vaccine, and priority risk category of patients, and recorded the regional weekly incidence in the general population."
35144968,Incidence rate ratios at different time intervals were estimated by multilevel negative binomial models with robust variance estimator.,We tracked the number of cases according to geographic region.
35144968,"Sex, age group, brand of vaccine, priority risk category, and regional weekly incidence in the general population were included as covariates.","Using infection rates at 0-14 days after the first dose of vaccine as our starting point, we followed the trend of vaccine effectiveness During the epidemic phase when the delta variant was the most common strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased from 82% at 3-4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine to 33% at 27-30 weeks after the second dose."
35144968,Geographic region was included as a random effect.,"In the same time range, vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 also decreased, although to a lesser extent, from an average of 96% to an average of 80%."
35144968,"Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-IRR)????100, where IRR=incidence rate ratio, with the time interval 0-14 days after the first dose of vaccine as the reference.","High risk people, those aged more than 80 years old, and those aged 60-79 years did not seem to be protected against infection at 27-30 weeks after the second dose of vaccine."
35144968,Results:,"Our results support vaccinating high risk people, those older than 60 years, and healthcare workers with a booster dose of vaccine six months after the primary vaccination cycle."
35144968,"During the epidemic phase when the delta variant was the predominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased (P<0.001) from 82% (95% confidence interval 80% to 84%) at 3-4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine to 33% (27% to 39%) at 27-30 weeks after the second dose.",Our results also suggest that giving the booster dose earlier than six months after the primary vaccination cycle and extending the offer of the booster dose to other groups of people might be a good idea.

35087066,"However, many countries extended this interval to accelerate population coverage with a single vaccine.","In registration studies, the two doses were delivered 3 weeks apart.."
35087066,It is not known how immune responses are influenced by delaying the second dose.,"However, many countries extended the time between the first and second doses to maximize the number of people vaccinated with one dose."
35087066,We provide the assessment of immune responses in the first 14 weeks after standard or extended-interval BNT162b2 vaccination and show that delaying the second dose strongly boosts the peak antibody response by 3.5-fold in older people.,It is not known how antibody responses or cellular immune responses are influenced by delaying the second dose.
35087066,This enhanced antibody response may offer a longer period of clinical protection and delay the need for booster vaccination.,We studied the immune response in the first 14 weeks after the standard 3-week interval or the extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination.
35087066,"In contrast, peak cellular-specific responses were the strongest in those vaccinated on a standard 3-week vaccine interval.",We showed that delaying the second dose strongly boosts the peak antibody response by 3.5-fold in older people.
35087066,"As such, the timing of the second dose has a marked influence on the kinetics and magnitude of the adaptive immune response after mRNA vaccination in older people.",This enhanced antibody response may offer a longer period of protection against infection and delay the need for booster vaccination.

34976499,We tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay.,"We collected blood samples one month after the first dose (Round 1), one month after the second dose (Round 2), and six months after the second dose (Round 3)."
34976499,We conducted a linear mixed model analysis to study the antibody kinetics and influencing factors.,We measured blood levels of antibodies against the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

34976499,The only significant predictor of IgG titers at six months was SARS-CoV-2 infection on mixed model analysis.,The only people who maintained high levels of antibodies at 6 months were in people who had been infected with SARS-CoV2.
34976499,Conclusion: We found a substantial decline in antibody levels leading to seven cases of seroreversion in healthcare professionals who received the ChAdOx1 vaccine.,We found a substantial decline in antibody levels leading to seven cases of loss of antibodies in healthcare professionals who received the ChAdOx1 vaccine.
34976499,History of prior COVID-19 was the only significant factor in antibody levels at six months.,A history of prior COVID-19 infection was the only significant reason for high antibody levels at six months.
34976499,Seroreversion and breakthrough infection warrant further research into the optimal timing and potential benefits of booster doses of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) COVID-19 vaccine.,More research needs to be conducted on the optimal timing and potential benefits of booster doses of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) COVID-19 vaccine to avoid breakthrough infections or loss of immunity.

34962970,Description of the long-term maintenance of both cellular and humoral responses elicited by real-world anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is still scarce.,Data about long-term immunity following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is still scarce.
34962970,Here we aimed to understand the development of optimal protective responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.,We studied the the development of the strongest protective immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.
34962970,"We performed an early, longitudinal study of S1-, M- and N-specific IFN-???? and IL-2 T cell immunity and anti-S total and neutralizing antibodies in 88 mild, moderate or severe acute COVID-19 patients.","We performed a long-term study of the immune responses and antibody blood levels in patients with mild, moderate or severe acute COVID-19 infection."
34962970,"Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity was also analysed in 234 COVID-19 recovered subjects, 28 uninfected BNT162b2-vaccinees and 30 uninfected healthy controls.","Immune response was also studied in 234 COVID-19 recovered subjects, 28 uninfected BNT162b2 (Pfizer)-vaccinees and 30 uninfected healthy unvaccinated people."
34962970,"Upon natural infection, cellular and humoral responses were early and coordinated in mild patients, while weak and inconsistent in severe patients.","During natural infection, immune responses were early and coordinated in patients with mild COVID-19, while the immune responses were weak and inconsistent in patients with severe illness."
34962970,The S1-specific cellular response measured at hospital arrival was an independent predictive factor against severity.,Immunity in patients was measured at hospital arrival.
34962970,"In COVID-19 recovered patients, four to seven months post-infection, cellular immunity was maintained but antibodies and neutralization capacity declined.",Patients with a strong cellular immune response against the virus spike protein had a less severe illness.
34962970,"Finally, a robust Th1-driven immune response was developed in uninfected BNT162b2-vaccinees.","In COVID-19 recovered patients, four to seven months post-infection, cellular immunity was maintained but antibody blood levels and the capacity of the antibodies to block the virus declined."

22087198,Renal histology reveals the presence of minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) in more than 80% of these patients.,"Most of the time, looking at kidney tissue under a microscope shows that there is Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS)."
22087198,Most patients with MCNS have favorable outcomes without complications.,Most people with MCNS can be cured without other issues.
22087198,"However, a few of these children have lesions of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, suffer from severe and prolonged proteinuria, and are at high risk for complications.","However, some children with NS have a different form called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis."
22087198,Complications of NS are divided into two categories: disease-associated and drug-related complications.,Children with this form have excess protein in their urine for long periods of time and are at high risk for additional problems.
22087198,"Disease-associated complications include infections (e.g., peritonitis, sepsis, cellulitis, and chicken pox), thromboembolism (e.g., venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism), hypovolemic crisis (e.g., abdominal pain, tachycardia, and hypotension), cardiovascular problems (e.g., hyperlipidemia), acute renal failure, anemia, and others (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypocalcemia, bone disease, and intussusception).","Additional problems caused by NS come in two categories: problems caused by the disease, and problems caused by drugs used to treat the disease."
22087198,The main pathomechanism of disease-associated complications originates from the large loss of plasma proteins in the urine of nephrotic children.,"Problems caused by the disease include infections, blood clots, shock, heart disease, kidney failure, anemia, and others."
22087198,The majority of children with MCNS who respond to treatment with corticosteroids or cytotoxic agents have smaller and milder complications than those with steroid-resistant NS.,The main way NS causes problems is from the large loss of proteins from the blood through urine.
22087198,"Corticosteroids, alkylating agents, cyclosporin A, and mycophenolate mofetil have often been used to treat NS, and these drugs have treatment-related complications.",Most children with MCNS that is treatable with drugs have fewer additional problems that children with NS that drugs cannot help.

25230687,"Design, setting, participants, and measurements: From July 2007 to June 2010, all of the elderly (aged ???65 years) Japanese primary NS patients who underwent native renal biopsies and were registered in the Japan renal biopsy registry (J-RBR; 438 patients including 226 males and 212 females) were identified.","From a registry in Japan, we found all Japanese NS patients 65 or older who had kidney biopsies (tissue samples) from July 2007 to June 2010."
25230687,"From this cohort, 61 patients [28 males and 33 females including 29, 19, 6, 4, and 3 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN), minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and other conditions, respectively] were registered from the representative multi-centers over all districts of Japan, and analyzed retrospectively.","This included 438 patients, 226 men and 212 women."
25230687,"The treatment outcome was assessed using proteinuria-based criteria; i.e., complete remission (CR) was defined as urinary protein level of <0.3 g/day or g/g Cr, and incomplete remission type I (ICR-I) was defined as urinary protein level of <1.0-0.3 g/day or g/g Cr, and renal dysfunction was defined as a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 times the baseline level.","Out of these patients, we looked closer at 61 that had certain types of NS."
25230687,Results:,"To know how well treatments worked, we looked at the levels of protein in the patients?? urine."
25230687,"In this elderly primary NS cohort, MN was the most common histological type of NS (54.8 %), followed by MCNS (19.4 %), FSGS (17.4 %), and MPGN (8.4 %).","In this group of older people with NS, more than half (58%) had a type called Membranous Nephropathy (MN)."
25230687,"Of the patients with MN, MCNS, or FSGS, immunosuppressive therapy involving oral prednisolone was performed in 25 MN patients (86.2 %), 18 MCNS patients (94.7 %), and all 6 FSGS patients (100 %).","Another 19% had Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS), 17% had Focal Segmental Glomerosclerosis (FSGS), and 8% had membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)."
25230687,CR was achieved in all 19 (100 %),"A drug called prednisolone, which suppresses the immune system, was given to 86% of the patients with MN, 94% of the patients with MCNS, and all 6 patients with FSGS."
25230687,MCNS patients.,The disease was completely cured in all 19 MCNS patients.
25230687,"In addition, CR and ICR-I were achieved in 16 (55.2 %) and 18 (62.1 %) MN patients and 4 (66.7 %) and 5 (83.3 %) FSGS patients, respectively.",Fifty-five percent of MN patients were completely cured and 62% were at least partially cured.
25230687,"There were significant differences in the median time to CR among the MCNS, FSGS, and MN patients (median: 26 vs. 271 vs. 461 days, respectively, p < 0.001), and between the elderly (65-74 years, n = 7) and very elderly (aged ???75 years, n = 12) MCNS patients (7 vs. 22 days, p = 0.037).",Sixty-six percent of FSGS patients were completely cured and 83% were partially cured.
25230687,Relapse occurred in two (6.9 %) of the MN and nine (47.4 %) of the MCNS patients.,There were meaningful differences in how long it took for different types of NS to be cured.
25230687,Renal dysfunction was observed in five (7.2 %) of the MN patients.,"The differences depended both on the type of NS (MCNS, FSGS, or MN) and whether MCNS patients were 75 or older."
25230687,"Serious complications developed in eight (14.8 %) patients, i.e., two (3.7 %)",The disease came back in 7% of patients with MN and 47% of patients with MCNS.
25230687,"patients died, four (7.4 %, including three MCNS patients) were hospitalized due to infectious disease, and two (3.7 %) developed malignancies.",Seven percent of patients with MN had problems with kidney function.
25230687,The initiation of diabetic therapy was necessary in 14 of the 61 patients (23.0 %) with much higher initial steroid dosage.,Eight patients had serious problems.
25230687,Conclusion: Renal biopsy is a valuable diagnostic tool for elderly Japanese NS patients.,"For example, two of them died, four were hospitalized for infections, and two developed malignant tumors."
25230687,"In this study, most of elderly primary NS patients respond to immunosuppressive therapy with favorable clinical outcomes.",Treatment for diabetes was needed for 14 of the 61 patients with higher initial steroid dosage.
25230687,"On the other hand, infectious disease is a harmful complication among elderly NS patients, especially those with MCNS.",Conclusions we can make include the fact that kidney biopsies are valuable for diagnosing NS in older Japanese patients.
25230687,"In future, modified clinical guidelines for elderly NS patients should be developed.","Also, in this study, most older NS patients responded well to drugs that suppress the immune system."
28089478,Background: Few studies have examined the treatment and outcome of adult-onset minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS).,Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS) is a kidney disease that can lead to a group of symptoms called Nephrotic Syndrome (NS).
28089478,We retrospectively studied 125 patients who had MCNS with onset in either adulthood or late adolescence.,Not many studies have looked at the treatment and results of MCNS that starts in adulthood.
28089478,"Presenting characteristics, duration of initial treatment and response to treatment, relapse patterns, complications, and long-term outcome were studied.",We looked at 125 patients from other studies that had MCNS appear as a late adolescent or adult.
28089478,Study design: Case series.,"We studied how the disease appeared, how long it was treated, and how patients responded to the treatment."
28089478,Setting & participants: Patients with new-onset nephrotic syndrome 16 years or older and a histologic diagnosis of MCNS in 1985 to 2011 were identified from pathology records of 10 participating centers.,"We also studied further problems caused by the disease and treatment, as well as long-term outcomes."
28089478,Outcomes:,The type of this study is to look at various cases.
28089478,"Partial and complete remission, treatment resistance, relapse, complications, renal survival.",We looked at pathology reports from 1985 to 2011 from 10 participating health care centers.
28089478,Results:,"From these, we found patients 16 years or older with new NS and a diagnosis of MCNS confirmed by looking at tissue under a microscope."
28089478,Corticosteroids were given as initial treatment in 105 (84%) patients.,"The cases had a variety of outcomes: partial and complete reversal of the disease, resistance of the disease to treatment, the disease coming back, further problems caused by the disease, and how long the kidneys functioned."
28089478,"After 16 weeks of corticosteroid treatment, 92 (88%) of these patients had reached remission.",Eighty-four percent of patients were given corticosteroids as an initial treatment.
28089478,"Median time to remission was 4 (IQR, 2-7) weeks.","After 16 weeks of corticosteroids, 88% of these patients were cured."
28089478,"7 (6%) patients initially received cyclophosphamide with or without corticosteroids, and all attained remission after a median of 4 (IQR, 3-11) weeks.","On average, time to reversing the disease was around 4 weeks."
28089478,13 (10%),"Six percent of patients at first were given a cancer drug called cyclophosphamide, either with or without corticosteroids."
28089478,patients reached remission without immunosuppressive treatment.,"All these patients were cured, in about 4 weeks on average."
28089478,One or more relapses were observed in 57 (54%) patients who received initial corticosteroid treatment.,Ten percent of patients were cured without drugs that suppress the immune system.
28089478,Second-line cyclophosphamide resulted in stable remission in 57% of patients with relapsing MCNS.,The disease returned at least once in 54% of patients that initially were given corticosteroids.
28089478,Acute kidney injury was observed in 50 (40%) patients.,Cyclophosphamide used as a second-choice alternative drug cured 57% of the patients who had returning MCNS.
28089478,Recovery of kidney function occurred almost without exception.,Forty percent of the patients had serious kidney damage.
28089478,Arterial or venous thrombosis occurred in 11 (9%) patients.,Kidney function returned in almost every case.
28089478,"At the last follow-up, 113 (90%)",Nine percent of patients had blood clots.
28089478,patients were in remission and had preserved kidney function.,"At the last follow-up, 90% of the patients still had the disease reversed and had functioning kidneys."
28089478,"3 patients with steroid-resistant MCNS progressed to end-stage renal disease, which was associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions on repeat biopsy.",Three patients with steroid-resistant MCNS continued to kidney failure.
28089478,Limitations:,The kidney failure came along with damage to the small structures of the kidney that were seen under a microscope.
28089478,"Retrospective design, variable treatment protocols.",This study is limited because we only looked at past patients and they were not all given the same treatments and dosages.
28089478,"Conclusions: The large majority of patients who had MCNS with onset in adulthood or late adolescence were treated with corticosteroids and reached remission, but many had relapses.",The first conclusion we can make is that most patients with MCNS that appeared as an adult or late adolescent were cured with corticosteroids.
28089478,Cyclophosphamide resulted in stable remission in many patients with relapses.,"However, many had the disease come back."
28089478,Significant morbidity was observed due to acute kidney injury and other complications.,"In many of the patients for whom the disease came back, treatment with cyclophosphamide kept it from coming back again."
28089478,Progression to end-stage renal disease occurred in a few patients and was explained by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.,Significant health problems were seen from serious damage to the kidneys and other problems caused by the disease.
32146646,"Background: Despite recent advances in immunosuppressive therapy for patients with primary nephrotic syndrome, its effectiveness and safety have not been fully studied in recent nationwide real-world clinical data in Japan.","New discoveries in treatments that suppress the immune system have helped patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), a group of symptoms relating to the kidneys."
32146646,"Methods: A 5-year cohort study, the Japan Nephrotic Syndrome Cohort Study, enrolled 374 patients with primary nephrotic syndrome in 55 hospitals in Japan, including 155, 148, 38, and 33 patients with minimal change disease (MCD), membranous nephropathy (MN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and other glomerulonephritides, respectively.","However, the safety and effectiveness of these treatments has not been fully studied for recent cases in Japan."
32146646,"The incidence rates of remission and relapse of proteinuria, 50% and 100% increases in serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), all-cause mortality, and other major adverse outcomes were compared among glomerulonephritides using the Log-rank test.","A study 5 years ago followed 374 patients with NS in Japan, across 55 hospitals."
32146646,"Incidence of hospitalization for infection, the most common cause of mortality, was compared using a multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model.","It included 155 patients with Minimal Change Disease (MCD), 148 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN), 38 patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and 33 patients with other types of inflammation of the small filtering structures in the kidney."
32146646,Results:,"Among these diseases, we compared how often proteinuria (too much protein in the urine) was cured and came back."
32146646,Immunosuppressive therapy was administered in 339 (90.6%) patients.,"We also compared how often patients died, had kidney failure, or had other serious problems."
32146646,"The cumulative probabilities of complete remission within 3 years of the baseline visit was ??? 0.75 in patients with MCD, MN, and FSGS (0.95, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively).",The most common cause of death was being hospitalized for an infection.
32146646,"Diabetes was the most common adverse events associated with immunosuppressive therapy (incidence rate, 71.0 per 1000 person-years).",We compared this cause among the different diseases using statistical methods.
32146646,"All-cause mortality (15.6 per 1000 person-years), mainly infection-related mortality (47.8%), was more common than ESKD (8.9 per 1000 person-years), especially in patients with MCD and MN.",We found that treatment to suppress the immune system was given to 339 patients.
32146646,MCD was significantly associated with hospitalization for infection than MN.,"For patients with MCD, MN, FSGS, there was more than a 75% chance the disease was completely cured within 3 years."
32146646,"Conclusions: Patients with MCD and MN had a higher mortality, especially infection-related mortality, than ESKD.",The most common side effect of treatments suppressing the immune system was diabetes.
32146646,Nephrologists should pay more attention to infections in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome.,"In each year, a person had a 71 in 1000 chance of this happening."
34362836,Background: Little population-based data exist about adults with primary nephrotic syndrome.,Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a combination of symptoms relating to the kidneys.
34362836,"Methods: To evaluate kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes in adults with primary nephrotic syndrome, we identified adults within an integrated health care delivery system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) with nephrotic-range proteinuria or diagnosed nephrotic syndrome between 1996 and 2012.",There is not much information about how NS exists in the population.
34362836,"Nephrologists reviewed medical records for clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results to confirm primary nephrotic syndrome and assigned etiology.","We looked at kidney health, heart disease, and death in adults within Kaiser Permanente of Northern California that had symptoms of NS between 1996 and 2012."
34362836,"We identified a 1:100 time-matched cohort of adults without diabetes, diagnosed nephrotic syndrome, or proteinuria as controls to compare rates of ESKD, cardiovascular outcomes, and death through 2014, using multivariable Cox regression.",Kidney specialists looked at medical records to confirm NS and determined causes.
34362836,Results:,"For comparison, we also found a group of adults with no diabetes, NS, or proteinuria (too much protein in the urine) through 2014."
34362836,"We confirmed 907 patients with primary nephrotic syndrome (655 definite and 252 presumed patients with FSGS [40%], membranous nephropathy","This group was to compare rates of kidney failure, heart disease, and death using statistical methods."
34362836,"[40%], and minimal change disease [20%]).",We confirmed 907 patients with NS.
34362836,Mean age was 49 years; 43% were women.,"Of these, 655 definitely had either Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Membranous Nephropathy (MN), or Minimal Change Disease (MCD)."
34362836,"Adults with primary nephrotic syndrome had higher adjusted rates of ESKD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 19.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 12.76 to 30.20), acute coronary syndrome (aHR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.89 to 3.52), heart failure (aHR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.16 to 4.19), ischemic stroke (aHR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.05), venous thromboembolism (aHR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.35 to 4.85), and death (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.64) versus controls.",Another 252 were presumed to have one of these.
34362836,Excess ESKD risk was significantly higher for FSGS and membranous nephropathy than for presumed minimal change disease.,"The average age of the patients was 49, and 43% were women."
34362836,The three etiologies of primary nephrotic syndrome did not differ significantly in terms of cardiovascular outcomes and death.,Adults with NS had about 20 times the rate of kidney failure compared to people with no NS.
34362836,"Conclusions: Adults with primary nephrotic syndrome experience higher adjusted rates of ESKD, cardiovascular outcomes, and death, with significant variation by underlying etiology in the risk for developing ESKD.","They also had about two and a half times the rate of heart-related chest pain, three times the rate of heart failure, almost twice the rate of stroke, two and a half times the rate of blood clots, and 34% higher rate of death."
35102405,Nephrotic syndrome (NS) encompasses a variety of disease processes leading to heavy proteinuria and edema.,Nephrotic syndrome (NS) includes a variety of underlying diseases that lead to serious proteinuria (too much protein in the blood) and edema (fluid buildup).
35102405,"Minimal change disease (MCD) remains the most common primary cause of NS, as well as the most responsive to pharmacologic treatment with often minimal to no chronic kidney disease.","Minimal change disease (MCD) is still the most common cause of NS, and is the most responsive to treatment with drugs, often with little or no chronic kidney disease."
35102405,"Other causes of NS include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which follows MCD, and secondary causes, including extrarenal or systemic diseases, infections, and drugs.","Other causes of NS include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which follows MCD, and secondary causes, including diseases outside the kidneys, infections, and drugs."
35102405,"Although initial diagnosis relies on clinical findings as well as urine and blood chemistries, renal biopsy and genetic testing are important diagnostic tools, especially when considering non-MCD NS.",The initial diagnosis relies on signs and symptoms observed by a doctor.
35102405,"Moreover, biomarkers in urine and serum have become important areas for research in this disease.","However, urine and blood tests, kidney tissue samples, and genetic testing are also important for diagnosis."
35102405,"NS progression and prognosis are variable and depend on etiology, with corticosteroids being the mainstay of treatment.",This is especially true for NS not caused by MCD.
35102405,Other alternative therapies found to be successful in inducing and maintaining remission include calcineurin inhibitors and rituximab.,"Additionally, signs of disease in blood and urine have become important areas for research in this disease."
35102405,Disease course can range from recurrent disease relapse with or without acute kidney injury to end-stage renal disease in some cases.,The outcomes of NS and the way it progresses can vary and depend on the underlying disease.
35102405,"Given the complex pathogenesis of NS, which remains incompletely understood, complications are numerous and diverse and include infections, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and thrombosis.",Corticosteroids are the main treatment.
35102405,"Pediatricians must be aware of the presentation, complications, and overall long-term implications of NS and its treatment.",Alternative treatments that have been found to work include calcineurin inhibitors (a class of drugs that suppress the immune system) and rituximab (Rituxan).
35017338,"Children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) have a number of potential risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) including intravascular volume depletion, infection, exposure to nephrotoxic medication, and renal interstitial edema.",Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a combination of kidney-related symptoms.
35017338,This study was aimed to determine the incidence of AKI in children hospitalized with a relapse of NS and its short-term outcome.,Children with NS are at risk for serious kidney damage for a number of reasons.
35017338,This prospective observational study was conducted from February 2017 to January 2018 at a tertiary care teaching hospital.,"These include too little blood, infection, medications, and swelling in the kidneys."
35017338,A total of 54 children and adolescents (1-18 years) hospitalized with a diagnosis of NS and relapse with/or without other complications were enrolled.,"The aim of this study was to find out how often serious kidney damage happens in children that had NS come back, and the short-term outcome of that damage."
35017338,Clinical data and examination were recorded.,This study followed people over time and was conducted from February 2017 to January 2018 at a teaching hospital with highly specialized care.
35017338,"AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) serum creatinine criteria and Pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (p-RIFLE) classification.","We enrolled a total of 54 children and adolescents who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of NS that came back, with or without associated problems."
35017338,Children who developed AKI during the first two weeks of hospitalization were followed up till recovery or six weeks whichever was earlier to determine the outcome and factors predisposing to AKI.,We recorded health-related information.
35017338,The mean age of the study population was 59.5 months and 35 (64.8%),"To figure out what puts children more at risk for serious kidney damage, we followed up with children who had this problem during the first two weeks of hospitalization."
35017338,patients were male.,"We continued following up with them either until they recovered or until six weeks, whichever was earlier."
35017338,"Of the 54 patients hospitalized, 42 (77.8%) were admitted with infection-associated relapses while 22.2% of children had relapse alone.",The average age of people in the study was 59.5 months.
35017338,Diarrhea and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were the most common infections (26.1% each) followed by urinary tract infections in 19% and pneumonia in 14.3%.,Thirty-five of the patients (65%) were male.
35017338,Twenty-three (42.6%) children developed AKI according to the KDIGO definition and 27 (50%) using the pRIFLE classification.,"Out of the 54 patients that were hospitalized, 42 had returning NS that was associated with infections."
35017338,Fourteen (60.9%) had stage 2 AKI while 21.7% had stage 3 AKI.,Twenty-two percent of children had returning NS only.
35017338,Infections [odds ratio (OR) 1.24] and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (OR 2.3) were the most common predisposing factors for AKI.,"The most common infections were diarrhea and bacterial infections of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity."
35017338,The mean recovery time for AKI was 7.34 days.,The next most common were urinary tract infections and pneumonia.
35017338,Development of AKI was associated with prolonged hospital stay (12.57 vs.8.55 days P <0.01) and delayed recovery.,"Twenty-three or 27 children developed serious kidney damage, depending on the criteria used."
35017338,At the end of follow-up all children recovered from AKI.,The most common factors that increased risk of serious kidney damage were infections and the use of ACE inhibitors.
35017338,The incidence of AKI in children hospitalized with complications of NS is high.,The average time for recovery from the serious kidney damage was about 7 days.
35017338,"While the occurrence of these AKI episodes may appear transient, a recurrence of such episodes may be detrimental to the long-term outcome of children with NS.",Serious kidney damage was associated with longer hospital stays and delayed recovery.
35017338,Infections and the use of ACEI during relapses are risk factor for the occurrence of AKI.,"At the end of the followup, all children recovered from the kidney damage."
34979093,"Background: Although venous thromboembolism is a well-known complication of nephrotic syndrome, the long-term absolute and relative risks of arterial thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism, and bleeding in adults with nephrotic syndrome remain unclarified.","Blood clots are a well-known problem associated with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), a group of kidney-related symptoms."
34979093,"Methods: In this matched cohort study, we identified every adult with first-time recorded nephrotic syndrome from admissions, outpatient clinics, or emergency department visits in Denmark during 1995-2018.","However, the risks of blood clots and bleeding in adults with NS is not clear."
34979093,Each patient was matched by age and sex with 10 individuals from the general population.,This study looked at groups of similar people with and without disease.

34979093,[3.40-4.75]) compared with the general population comparators after adjusting for confounders.,"The highest bleeding risks were of stroke, heart attack, and gastrointestinal bleeding."
34979093,"Conclusion: Adults with nephrotic syndrome have a high risk of arterial thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism, and bleeding compared with the general population.","During the first year, patients with NS had higher rates of blood clots in arteries, blood clots in veins, and bleeding than the people from the general population."
34979093,The mechanisms and consequences of this needs to be clarified.,"In conclusion, adults with NS have a higher risk of blood clots, both in arteries and veins, and bleeding compared to the general population."
34839817,"Background: Steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), while uncommon in children, is associated with significant morbidity.",Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS) is a group of kidney-related symptoms that cannot be treated with steroids.
34839817,"Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) remain the first line recommended therapy for children with non-genetic forms of SRNS, but some children fail to respond to them.","Though it is not common in children, it is associated with many serious health problems."

34839817,"Data abstracted included demographics, histopathology on renal biopsy, prior and concomitant use of other immunosuppressive agents and serial clinical/laboratory data.",Our study looked at the outcome of IV CTX treatment in North American children with this disease.
34839817,Primary outcome measure was attainment of complete remission (CR).,The study was a review of previous medical records of children with SRNS-DTT treated with IV CTX from January 2000 to July 2019 at our center.
34839817,Results: Eight children with SRNS-DTT received monthly doses (median 6; range 4-6) of IV CTX.,"From these records, we looked at demographics, kidney tissue samples, and the use of drugs to suppress the immune system."
34839817,"Four (50%) went into CR, 1 achieved partial remission and 3 did not respond.",We also looked at notes from office visits and lab results recorded over time.
34839817,Three of the 4 responders had minimal change disease (MCD).,The main outcome that we measured was complete reversal of the disease.
34839817,"Excluding the 1 child who responded after the 4th infusion, the median time to CR was 6.5 (range 0.5-8) months after completion of IV CTX infusions.",We found that 8 children with SRNS-DTT were given monthly doses of IV CTX.
34839817,Three remain in CR at a median of 8.5 years (range: 3.7-10.5 years) after completion of CTX; one child relapsed and became steroid-dependent.,"Four were completely cured, one was partially cured, and three did not respond to the treatment."
34839817,No infections or life-threatening complications related to IV CTX were observed.,Three of the four patients that were cured had a particular type of SRNS that was caused by Minimal Change Disease (MCD).
34839817,Conclusions: IV CXT can induce long term remission in North-American children with MCD who have SRNS-DTT.,"Except for the one child who responded to treatment after the 4th dose, the average time to reverse the disease was about six and a half months after completing all the IV CTX doses."
34775776,"Chylothorax is an uncommon and serious clinical condition, typically induced by trauma, either postsurgical or accidental injury, but the mechanism of chylothorax caused by nephrotic syndrome is still unclear.",Chylothorax is an uncommon and serious medical condition where fluid from the lymphatic system builds up around the lungs.
34775776,"Here, we report a case of primary nephrotic syndrome with membranous nephropathy (MN) in a 66-year-old man who presented with severe chylothorax.","It is typically caused by serious damage to the body, either after surgery or an accident."
34775776,"The chylothorax was managed by intercostal chest tube drainage, subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin, and treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and diuretics.","However, we don??t know how a cluster of kidney-related symptoms called Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) causes chylothorax."
34775776,"After treatment, the patient's pleural effusion decreased, and the chyle gradually became clear.",In this article we describe a case of NS with a kidney disease called Membranous Nephropathy (MN) in a 66 year old man with severe chylothorax.
34775776,We discuss the causes of MN with chylothorax.,"The chylothorax was kept under control with a drainage tube inserted into the chest, injections of a drug called enoxaparin, and treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and diuretics, which increase urine production."
34775776,"We considered that the hypoproteinemia changed the permeability of mucous membranes and lymphatic vessels, leading to leakage of chylous particles and chylous pleural effusion formation.","After treatment, the fluid around the lungs decreased and became clear."
34775776,"Chylothorax may also have been caused by severe tissue edema, edema of the lymphatic walls, and increased pressure, resulting in increased permeability or rupture of the lymphatic wall, and leakage of chylous fluid into the thoracic cavity.",We will talk about the causes of MN with chylothorax.
34775776,"Because of its rarity, we hope this case report will improve clinicians' understanding of MN complications in primary nephrotic syndrome and provide suitable treatment options for future clinical reference.",We thought that maybe too little protein in the blood allowed fluid from the lymphatic system to leak through tissues and cause the buildup around the lungs.
