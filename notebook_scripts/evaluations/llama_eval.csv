"Purpose: Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with a Baker's cyst.  Besides osteoarthritis, also other joint pathologies of the knee can be causative for a Baker's cyst.  Radiotherapy is known to be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect.  As the excessive production of synovia usually is associated with intraarticular inflammation, our hypothesis was that radiotherapy might positively influence the synovial production and reduce the volume of a Baker's cyst.  Materials and methods: We performed a prospective trial, including 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis.  Besides documentation of NRS (numeric rating scale), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score and Knee Society Score, the volume of the Baker's cyst was calculated for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up.  Ultrasonic volumetry was performed using an ultrasound device with a high-resolution multifrequency linear probe (6-9 MHz).  Results: Low-dose radiotherapy improved NRS, WOMAC score and Knee Society Score significantly.  The mean volume of Baker's cyst decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively 3.1 ml during follow-up.  A decrease in volume of more than 25% compared to the baseline could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up.  Conclusion: Radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a Baker's cyst.  Most patients respond to the treatment.  Whether radiotherapy is an effective treatment for Baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis has to be further examined.","Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common disease, often associated with a Baker's cyst.

"Background: This study aimed to compare the arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone or in combination with cyst wall resection in terms of clinical outcomes.  Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts received arthroscopic treatment.  Specifically, 20 of them received arthroscopic internal drainage (AI group) alone and 22 received arthroscopic internal drainage combined with cyst wall resection (AICR group) through double posteromedial portals.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to identify recurrence of popliteal cysts.  The Lysholm score and Rauschning-Lindgren grade were used to assess the clinical outcomes.  The median of the follow-up period was 24 months (12-48 months). Results: The two groups (AI group and AICR group) were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, preoperative Lysholm score, preoperative Rauschning-Lindgren grade and follow-up period (P > 0.05).  Relative to the AI group, the AICR group had a significantly prolonged operation time (P < 0.05) and a higher incidence of complications (P < 0.05).  In both groups, the Rauschning-Lindgren grade at the last follow-up significantly differed from the preoperative grade (P < 0.05) and the Lysholm knee score remarkably increased compared to the preoperative score (P < 0.05); however, there were no differences between the two groups at the last follow-up (P > 0.05).  According to the MRI results, the cyst disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in size in 6 (30%) and existed in 3 (15%) patients in the AI group, and was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in size in 4 (18.2%) patients in the AICR group, suggesting a significant difference between the two (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Additional resection of cyst wall can result in a lower recurrence rate of cysts but extend the operation time and increase the incidence of perioperative complications compared with arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone.

"Objective: To review the results of arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analyse outcomes including complications.   Patients: From July 2007 to July 2009, 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated arthroscopically.  All of them had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valvular opening, and the associated intra-articular pathology.  We used the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria for evaluation.  Results: Intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear were commonly associated with popliteal cysts.  All patients achieved symptomatic improvement after treatment and the recurrence rate was low.  No major complications were encountered.  We failed to identify (and correct) any valvular opening in one patient.  Conclusion: From our experience, we conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valvular opening and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe.","We reviewed the results of arthroscopic (joint-related) treatment of popliteal cysts (growths) in our centre and analyzed outcomes including complications.

"Popliteal cyst is a common peri-knee cyst, also known as a Baker's cyst. With the current development of popliteal cysts, the pathogenesis is mainly due to increased pressure in the knee joint caused by various reasons, leading to a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee as a result of enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa. The current diagnostic methods include X-ray computed, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance. Among them, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts. There are various treatments, including conservative treatment, traditional surgical resection and arthroscopic surgery. In recent years, the focus of the treatment of popliteal cysts has gradually shifted from the simple removal of cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, and achieved a good effect. However, there are still controversies about the most effective treatment, and the best surgery method is still uncertained. It is hoped that high quality prospective studies will be able to directly compare different surgery methods, so as to select the best treatment for popliteal cyst. This article reviews past literature research and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, clinical manifestations and signs, auxiliary examination, diagnosis and differential diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts. Different diagnosis methods and treatment methods are compared and summarized to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Popliteal cysts are common cysts around the knee, also known as a Baker's cyst.

"Context: Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are commonly found in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. Histologically, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue with fibrosis evident, and there may be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may also be found within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. Baker's cysts can be a source of posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they are routinely discovered on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and may be related to size. Conclusion: A capsular opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa is a commonly found normal anatomic variant. It is thought that this can lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst in the presence of chronic knee effusions as a result of intra-articular pathology. Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. The intra-articular pathology should be first addressed by arthroscopy. If surgical excision later becomes necessary, a limited posteromedial approach is often employed. Other treatments, such as arthroscopic debridement and closure of the valvular mechanism, are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended.","Popliteal (knee) synovial (joint) cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are commonly found in association with knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis (joint inflammation) and meniscus tears.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to introduce a modified arthroscopic treatment technique for popliteal cyst and hypothesize that this modified technique would provide good clinical efficacy and low recurrence rate. Methods: From January 2013 to January 2017, 34 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated with our technique. A figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals were used to achieve adequate enlargement of the posteromedial valvular opening between the cyst and the joint cavity and complete excision of the cyst wall. MRI was used to detect the recurrence of the popliteal cyst, and the Rauschning and Lindgren score was recorded to evaluate the clinical outcome. Results: All patients were followed up with a mean period of 14.8 months (range, 12 to 36 months). Associated intra-articular lesions were found and treated in all cases. Degenerative cartilage damage was the most common pathology, which affected 23 (67.6%) of the cases. The Rauschning and Lindgren score improved significantly after surgery, and no evidence of recurrence was found from MRI in any case. Conclusions: Our modified arthroscopic treatment technique, using a figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals, is effective and safe for treating popliteal cyst.","The aim of this study was to introduce a modified arthroscopic (joint-related) treatment technique for popliteal cyst and hypothesize that this modified technique would provide good patient outcomes and low recurrence rate.

"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, reached epidemic proportions. Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions. There is consensus that a 'window of opportunity' exists during pregnancy and early in life when environmental factors may influence its development. We review multiple environmental, biologic and sociologic factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Meta-analyses of studies have demonstrated that multifaceted interventions are required in order to develop asthma prevention. Multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefits. Asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. The increasing prevalence of asthma also may be an indication of increased population risk for the development of other chronic non-communicable autoimmune diseases. This review will focus on the factors which may be important in the primary prevention of asthma. Better understanding of the complex gene-environment interactions involved in the development of asthma will provide insight into personalized interventions for asthma prevention.","Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, reached epidemic proportions.

"Purpose of review: The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries. The present review focuses on recent literature regarding asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings: Several environmental exposures in infancy or early childhood are associated with reduced prevalence of asthma, but the mechanisms leading to these associations remain unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated limited success in the prevention of asthma or asthma symptoms with the use of asthma medications, once the therapy is discontinued. Immunotherapy offers another strategy for asthma prevention, and groups treated with this intervention have demonstrated reduced atopy and asthma. Several multi-interventional trials have demonstrated a reduced asthma symptom burden but have not demonstrated significant differences in objective measures such as lung function or bronchial hyper-responsiveness between intervention groups. Summary: The most promising asthma prevention strategies to date have been those that use a multi-interventional approach employing both dietary and environmental manipulations. More research is needed to assess the long-term follow-up of multi-interventional trials and to evaluate novel intervention strategies in the primary or secondary prevention of asthma in childhood.","Asthma is a common chronic disease of the airways.

"Corticosteroids have been used for decades to modulate inflammation therapeutically, yet there is a paucity of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or ""immunome"", in healthy humans after systemic corticosteroid administration. We used multiplexed techniques to query the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline, and after intravenous hydrocortisone (HC) administered at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses, to provide insight into how corticosteroids exert their effects. We performed comprehensive phenotyping of 120 lymphocyte subsets by high dimensional flow cytometry, and observed a decline in circulating specific B and T cell subsets, which reached their nadir 4-8 hours after administration of HC. However, B and T cells rebounded above baseline 24 hours after HC infusion, while NK cell numbers remained stable. Whole transcriptome profiling revealed down regulation of NF-κB signaling, apoptosis, and cell death signaling transcripts that preceded lymphocyte population changes, with activation of NK cell and glucocorticoid receptor signaling transcripts. Our study is the first to systematically characterize the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome, and we demonstrate that HC exerts differential effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. Fauci et al. reported that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a transient nadir in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes at 4–6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data are consistent with these observations. We also observed differential effects of the two steroid doses on lymphocyte recovery at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells rebounding above baseline after the 250 mg dose and total NK cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. HC induced a rapid decline in circulating monocytes and mRNAs related to innate immune signaling as early as one hour after infusion. These effects preceded neutrophil demargination and lymphocyte depletion.","Steroids, which are hormones, have been used for decades to control inflammation (redness and swelling) in the body, yet there is a lack of data on their effects in humans.

"Background and objective: The purpose of this study was to create a practical CT-based algorithm to differentiate Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome from other diffuse cystic lung diseases (DCLD). Methods: The study was a retrospective review of the CT images of 33 patients with BHD syndrome, 33 patients with LAM, and 23 patients with NBNL (non-BHD and non-LAM) among DCLD patients. On the basis of the data collected, the CT images were reviewed again to evaluate the characteristics (size, number, distribution, and morphology) of pulmonary cysts. Results: Lower lung-predominant cysts were more likely to be found in patients with BHD syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the NBNL DCLD group. In the axial distribution, 18 of 33 patients in BHD group had cysts that were predominantly near the mediastinum, and all the patients in the LAM and NBNL DCLD groups had diffuse cysts. The appearance of fusiform cysts was more easily observed in patients in the BHD group. In total, 58% patients in the BHD group had less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-BHD group had more than 50 lung cysts. The biggest cyst was located in the lower lobe in 28 of 33 patients in the BHD group, while 11 of 33 patients in LAM group and 10 patients in the NBNL DCLD group had the biggest cyst in the lower lobe.

"Germline mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene FLCN are responsible for the autosomal dominant inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome that predisposes to fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors. Although the encoded protein, folliculin (FLCN), has no sequence homology to known functional domains, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the C-terminus of FLCN has structural similarity to DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain proteins that act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small Rab GTPases. FLCN forms a complex with folliculin interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This review summarizes FLCN functional studies which support a role for FLCN in diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes that include modulation of the mTOR pathway, regulation of PGC1α and mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion and RhoA signaling, control of TFE3/TFEB transcriptional activity, amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 on lysosomes through Rag GTPases, and regulation of autophagy. Ongoing research efforts are focused on clarifying the primary FLCN-associated pathway(s) that drives the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and kidney tumors in BHD patients carrying germline FLCN mutations.","Mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene FLCN (folliculin) are responsible for the inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome that predisposes to growths in the skin called fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung), and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors.

"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 100 countries worldwide and the discharge criteria of patients with COVID-19 vary across different countries. In China, patients with two negative respiratory viral RNA tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine required. Currently, PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed. Methods: We present a patient with COVID-19, whose respiratory swabs became negative but fecal sample remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: Stool sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab. Conclusions: Based on the experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic, we recommend that fecal RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2 should be incorporated into the discharge criteria to minimize the risk of transmission from the gastrointestinal tract.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 100 countries worldwide and the discharge criteria of patients with COVID-19 varies across different countries.
